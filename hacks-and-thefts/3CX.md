# 3CX 

Date:: April 20, 2023


DPRK Malware Breach Was a Double Supply Chain Compromise

## Details

In March, hackers compromised 3CX’s desktop applications for Windows and macOS and bundled them with malware. As a result, customers of 3CX inadvertentl  downloaded malicious versions of the company’s voice- and video-calling software. Using the malicious versions of the software, the attackers were able to download and run arbitrary code on victim machines. This supply chain attack114 was the result of a previous supply chain attack on Trading Technologies, a financial software firm – a rare example of how a single perpetrator used one software supply chain attack to carry out another downstream. Targets included critical infrastructure in the energy sector. Cybersecurity companies have attributed this attack to the Lazarus Group.
