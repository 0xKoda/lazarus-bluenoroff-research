Ankitt Gaur, founder and CEO of Layer 2 DeFi lending protocol EasyFi (EASY), said, “On April 19, team members reported that a large number of EASY tokens were transferred from the official EasyFi wallet to the Ethereum network and several unknowns on the Polygon network

The hacker successfully obtained the administrator key and transferred $6 million of existing liquid funds in the form of USD/DAI/USDT from the protocol pool, and transferred 298 Ten thousand EASY tokens (approximately 30% of the total supply of EASY tokens, currently valued at 40.9 million U.S

By stealing the private keys to EasyFi’s MetaMask admin account, hackers were able to extract $6M in USD, DAI, and USDT, plus 2.98M EASY tokens, all of which amounted to around $81M 

The machine that was compromised to gain the keys was offline most of the time, only being switched on to perform official transfers for the project 

When the attack was carried out, the machine had been offline for more than a week And because it wasn’t actively used when the attack was carried out, this delayed the platform’s response and allowed the hacker to drain the assets from the protocol. get access to admin keys and remove existing liquidity to the tune of $6 million from protocol pools in USD / DAI / USDT and transfer 2.98 Million EASY tokens 

While most metamask attacks phish private keys / mnemonic phrases by tricking into downloading a malicious version, this is not the case here 

My computer was compromised and MetaMask was altered from the disk 

The physical machine was not tampered with, and it seems to be the issue with some remote access as might have been previously used on Hugh Karp 

From the initial investigations, it looks like hackers are extremely sophisticated and quite likely working as part of a larger group 

The impact upon users was limited when the EASY token’s price crashed by 50% in a low-liquidity scenario, making it difficult for the hacker to sell his tokens 

The token was upgraded to ‘EZ 2.0’ four days later, making the hacker’s holdings useless 

Hackers compromised a computer belonging to EasyFi founder Ankitt Gaur, accessing his private keys which allowed them to transfer $6 million in Stablecoins and $120 million worth of EASY

The price of EASY crashed as a result of the low liquidity, limiting the hacker's total payout to around $80 million

EasyFi followed the breach with a hard fork to EZ 2.0, and compensated users with a mix of Stablecoins and IOU tokens that could later be redeemed for discounted EZ.
