## Details

Likely a private key compromise or intentional backdoor insertion.

The attacker(s) stole an estimated USD 1.8 million from the protocol by draining its liquidity pools as users were adding assets as part of a ‚Äúliquidity Generation Event‚Äù and token launch.

The underlying issue was overly-centralized control ‚Äì namely, excessive permissions granted to the Feeto address used during liquidity pool deployment. This address had full access and permissions, enabling individual(s) controlling the address to drain the pool of assets.

The Merlin Platform placed blame on members of their back-end development team ‚Äì possibly DPRK IT workers inadvertently hired by the protocol. The Platform accused the developers of maliciously manipulating the smart contracts and exploiting the full access/approvals feature, allowing them to drain the liquidity pools.

The stolen funds were bridged back to Ethereum, swapped for Ether (ETH) and transferred to other addresses.
