## Details

Terraport Finance is a defi project built on, believe it or not, the Terra blockchain. Yes, the same Terra blockchain on which the Terra/Luna projects were built. Despite the [massive collapse](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=terra-luna-token-drops-in-price-by-98-amidst-ongoing-terrausd-stablecoin-collapse) of the flagship project in May 2022, there are still a number of Terra projects operating, and even some new projects being developed.

Terraport Finance launched on March 31, apparently having gone live without any sort of audit. On April 10, Terraport disclosed that an attacker had apparently managed to drain all project liquidity pools, making off with assets priced at around $2 million.

On the morning of April 10th, Terraport was exploited resulting in losses of approximately 4 million USD in Terra, LUNC, and USTC tokens.

The hack was made possible due to a mathematical weakness in the algorithm used to calculate LP prices. The malicious actor added a minor amount of liquidity to the protocol and then manipulated the LP share price, allowing them to withdraw a large amount of liquidity. 

Two pools were affected, the first one drained for 9,148,426 TERRA ($1.8 million) and 15,100,861,997 LUNC ($1.88 million), and the second one for 576,736 TERRA ($115K) and 5,487,381 USTC ($117K). The total losses amount to about $4 million USD.


Attacker(s) drained all of the liquidity pools on Terraport, a newly-launched decentralized exchange platform

The attacker(s) stole the funds in two transactions, in total withdrawing 9.7 million TERRA (Terraportâ€™s native token) tokens, 15 billion Luna Classic (LUNC) tokens and 5.5 million of the Terra Classic USD stablecoin (USTC) tokens.

A wallet involved in the Terraport launch was found to have made a series of suspicious changes to the code of three important smart contracts related to the liquidity pools, several hours before the heist was effected.
