"Malware designed to mine Monero and send any mined currency to servers located at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang was analysed.38 Separately, according to another report, the Republic of Korea Financial Security Institute specifically attributed a similar cryptojacking attack on an Republic of Korea companyâ€™s computer to Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea hackers.39 According to the report, the malware is believed to have generated approximately - $25,000 worth of Monero for the hackers who deployed the malware. Given the increased anonymity of Monero, it is difficult to determine the total amount of revenue that the Democratic Peopleâ€™s Republic of Korea may be generating from such attacks. Nevertheless, this cryptojacking incident suggests the increasingly sophisticated use of cryptojacking by the Democratic Republic of Korea and its willingness to use malware to generate cryptocurrency through mining for the benefit of the regime."
