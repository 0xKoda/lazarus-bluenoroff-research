> Good morning!

> As Jack said, there should be an explanation about the unexpected token movements this morning.
> The explanation is simple and yet unpleasant, the recovery key for one of the company hd wallets has been exposed.
> The unallowed access led to calling the transfer functions of token lock contracts (anybody can do that) to the defined target addresses, which were part of that company hd wallet.

> 1,93 mio locked UBT have been moved that way, additionally one of the “personal” wallets, that had been distributed to team members earlier that year.

> Our current state of the token model states that locked tokens are not planned to enter open market again, which – obviously – just happens.
> We feel terrible about that accident, and are currently ensuring that no other assets are harmed.

> We already contacted all clients that are connected with these projects and workshops, and as their locked in UBT already had been converted to transactions they are allowed to use within our solutions, they have no disadvantage. The contracts also had already been expired, so their buy back opportunity was also over.

> So the only remaining negative effect is that these tokens are obviously sold on the market.
> Ironically, we are currently preparing great news on a professional custody integration that will be the next step for the utility of UBT as the “Universal Blockchain Token”. Part of this news will be the replacement of token lock contracts by a fully automated integration into custody, incl. the coverage of underlying transaction costs in other crypto currencies, like ETH or native blockchain tokens. The event today showed once again how important custody is in enterprise environments.

> We are deeply sorry this happened and we will give our best to make up for it with great news about development, clients and partnerships, like we did in the last weeks and months.

> Thanks for you understanding and see you soon with better news 😉
