# Uno Re


Date:: November 14th, 2023

Amount Stolen:: $219,000 + 32.4M UNO


## Details

From the UNO Re DAO:

"On the recent attack on our capacity pools - what happened, event response, and what the plan ahead is:

The malicious party took over the ‘claims assessor’ role via a compromised owner/admin account, and used it to process a huge fraudulent “policy claim” that led to the drainage of our pools.

Consequently, a total of 32.4M $UNO, 127.9K $USDC, 59.3K $USDT, and 18.4 $ETH was misplaced.

Following these events, we’ve since focused on Fund Recovery and damage mitigation; the exploiter has been contacted on chain (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x153fa7888fee5641e4bbb622bc6e0a1b56d144b62a658da555aa793e786f6acf ), and we’ve also worked with teams over at KC, Gate, and MEXC to freeze funds. 

Our ETH-BSC bridge has also since been disabled. 

$UNO contracts were paused for a brief time to afford us enough time to coordinate with our CEX partners, however they’ve since been unpaused in the interest of maintaining decentralisation. 

We're currently also updating our dApp; at present, please do not interact with it or protocol contracts until further notice. 

Our focus now is two-fold; to release a much more comprehensive post-mortem of the entire event, and a Recompensation plan. 

All staker positions within the pools pre-event are recorded, and will be made whole again.  

(Our tokenomics has a completely reserved Reinsurance Liquidity cell built into it for unforeseen contingencies, which could play a role within this Recomp plan.)

The post-mortem will be published on all our socials, and the Recomp plan will undergo the UNO DAO voting process before being actioned. 

We’re already on our way to recovery, and will keep all DAO members, our community, and capacity providers in the loop at every step of the way via frequent updates like this."

The IP 85.255.176.177 was observed during initial laundering. Tactics and indicators changed later in the flows and for later laundering seessions.

It's highly likely this incident is similar to the one experienced by Terraport and that initial access was gained or significantly aided by one or more DPRK IT workers who were unknowingly employed and/or contracted by the UNO Re DAO.

For this reason, IoCs, on-chain flows, and other elements differ from the DPRK private key compromises that you are likely more familiar with. e.g. The attacker in this instance responded to the team's on-chain messages with a message of their own which rarely, if ever, occurs with DPRK hacks.

Similarly the team does not recall and has not identified receiving one of the infamous Google Docs "Risks of DeFi/Stablecoins(Protected)" that have been especially prevelant and damaging during Q3/Q4 2023.
