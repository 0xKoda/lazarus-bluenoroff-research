## Details II

- I do freelance software development work through the company Braintrust (www.usebraintrust.com).
- Braintrust is a legitimate service that connects clients with freelance software developers and handles communication, contracts, and payments/billing.
- I have worked successfully for clients before on Braintrust. I received an invite to apply for a job offer through Braintrust (note, I actively received the invite to apply from Braintrust via email - I was the 'passive party' and did not go searching for this job).
- I completed the job application and communicated with the client over the Braintrust platform.
- As part of the job application process I downloaded the code they shared to my laptop to see what I would be working on.
- This code was actually hidden obfuscated malware and infected my laptop.
- I deleted everything I could find and quarantined the laptop by turning off the internet connection, unfortunately it was too late.
- All my crypto funds in my crypto wallet have been drained to the attacker by their malware as it has found and transmitted my private keys/seed phrase.
- I don't know how they found it I am always very tight on digital hygiene and the only private key in plaintext was in .env files for my separate dev wallet that only contained $14 of gas tokens.
- In the current market this stolen crypto is worth roughly $12,600
