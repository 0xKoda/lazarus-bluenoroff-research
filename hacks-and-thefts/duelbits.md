## Details

Duelbits, a crypto casino and sports betting platform, experienced an exploit on February 13, 2024. The attacker gained access to a Duelbits wallet. The root cause of this exploit appears to be a loss of wallet access control. The attacker stole various assets, including ETH, BNB, BUSD, USDT, SHIBA INU, and ApeCoin, totaling a loss of 4,643,315 USD. The stolen funds were bridged, exchanged to ETH, and transferred to another EOA address.

Note: Initially thought to be dangerouspassword cluster but may turn out to be different due to the fact that it seems to have merged into Poloniex laundering going through Tornado Cash at the time
