Tags:: Private Key Compromise


## Details 

A bZx developer was sent a phishing email to his personal computer with a malicious macro in a Word document that was disguised as a legitimate email attachment, which then ran a script on his Personal Computer. 

The phishing attack was similar to one that affected another user recently named “mgnr.io”. 

This attack granted the hacker access to the content of the bZx Developers wallet, and also the private keys to the BSC and Polygon deployment of bZx Protocol. 

After gaining control of BSC and Polygon the hacker drained the BSC and Polygon protocol, then upgraded the contract to allow draining of all tokens that the contracts had given unlimited approval.

Beginning as a simple phishing attack in a Word document, the hackers managed to access private keys of the platform and ‘upgrade’ the smart contracts to transfer funds away. 

Most losses were on the Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks, while their decentralised infrastructure saw relatively lower losses denominated in Ethereum. 

On finding out what was happening, the bZx platform alerted other crypto projects and exchanges to freeze the stolen cryptocurrency. 

The company asked the Kaspersky security firm to investigate, who believe the hackers were the Lazarus Group with links to North Korea.
