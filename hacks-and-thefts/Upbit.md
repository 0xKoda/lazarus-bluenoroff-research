^^Rumors swirled that this was an Inside Job as the stolen crypto had allegedly been taken from Upbit’s cold wallet. ^^

South Korea Crypto exchange Upbit announced that 342,000 ETH worth about $50 million were sent to an unknown wallet in a suspected hack. The exchange has pledged to protect user assets, stating that the 342,000 ETH (roughly $50 million by press time) will be covered by corporate assets. It has already moved all crypto assets held in its hot wallet to cold storage. Announcing the news on Wednesday, UPbit said 342,000 ETH (currently worth nearly $50 million) were transferred from its ethereum “hot” wallet to an unknown wallet

The Exchange 3, a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange, had approximately 342,000 ETH ($48.5 million) stolen from it. 

Thankfully, Upbit promised to cover the losses. However, the story doesn’t end here. The stolen crypto has been on the move.  As of January 2020, Upbit has completed a major security update after a brief suspension of services. 

The Upbit hack is currently the most recent one as the company announced in a blog post that on November 27, 2019 it lost 58 billion won – $49.2 million at the time – worth of ^^ETH^^ to hackers as they transferred the funds out of Upbit’s hot wallet to an unknown wallet.

In response, Upbit immediately moved all of its funds to cold wallets and also disabled all trading activity. The company also promised to return all funds to affected users.




### US v. 280 Virtual Currency Accounts

> On or about November 27th, 2019. Approximately 342,000 ETH (valued at about $48.5 million) was stolen from Exchange 2. The investigation of the laundering of the funds stolen from Exchange 2, and funds related to additional hacks, identified a U.S.-based email account (“Target Email 1”) that a criminal actor (“Target Actor 1”) had used to launder funds from the scheme.

In or about December 2019, Target Actor 1 attempted to convert ETH to BTC through a cryptocurrency trading platform (“Exchange 9”) which was designed to enable the transfer of one form of cryptocurrency in exchange for another. Target Actor 1 submitted ETH for conversion into BTC, generating a transaction ID beginning with 6918d31f; however, Exchange 9 did not convert the ETH.

On or about December 20, 2019, Target Actor 1 contacted a separate virtual currency wallet provider requesting assistance with the transaction. Exchange 9 notified the virtual currency wallet provider that transaction ID 6918d31f would not be processed because it contained funds related to the hack of Exchange 2.

> The funds associated with transaction ID 6918d31f (“Defendant Property 1”) are currently frozen at Exchange 9, pursuant to their own internal policies.
