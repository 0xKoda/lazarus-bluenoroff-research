In an April 2018 hack of Gate.io — a case in which the  U.S. DOJ indicted and filed a civil forfeiture action against DPRK cybercriminals - North Korean hackers stole nearly $230 million worth of crypto assets. 

In this specific hack, North Korean actors programmed “automated scripts to rapidly launder and reconsolidate stolen funds into exchanges before transferring them into Lazarus-affiliated wallets,” which was evident due to the large number of simultaneous transactions. 

While we saw automation and other obfuscation techniques such as peeling chains — a series of smaller transactions of dispersion followed by consolidation in order to obfuscate larger transactions — the real key to this operation was to off ramp the cryptocurrency to fiat currency as quickly as possible, even at the expense of potential future attribution to the hack.
