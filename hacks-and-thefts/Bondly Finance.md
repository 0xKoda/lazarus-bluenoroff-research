# Bondly Finance

Date:: July 14th, 2021

Amount Stolen:: $5,900,000


## Details

On Wednesday, July 14th 2021, Bondly Finance fell victim to an attack from a malicious actor (Attacker) leading to the transfer of 373,088,023 $BONDLY tokens from the Bondly Staking Rewards contract, 200,460,000 of which were used to mint zenBONDLY in a sophisticated attack on the MANTRA DAO ZENTEREST platform. 

The digital collectibles market platform Bondly Finance released an analysis report on the previous attack. Bondly Finance believes that the attacker obtained access to the password account belonging to Bondly CEO Brandon Smith through a carefully planned strategy. The password account contains the assistance of his hardware wallet. Recalling the phrase to restore the phrase, after copying, allowed the attacker to access the BONDLY smart contract, and the company wallet that was also leaked, resulting in the minting of 373 million BONDLY tokens, or $5M

Hacker got access to a devs password and then manipulated a smart contract from the protocol

The breach also extended to a number of Bondly-held wallets, which were also compromised during the attack.

Upon initial investigation we believe the Attacker, through a well-orchestrated strategy, gained access to a password account belonging to Brandon Smith, CEO of Bondly. 

The password account contained a mnemonic recovery phrase for his hardware wallet, which when replicated allowed the assailant access to the $BONDLY smart contract, as well as corporate wallets that were also compromised.
