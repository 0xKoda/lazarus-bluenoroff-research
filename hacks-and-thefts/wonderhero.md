## Details

> Earlier today, there was an attack on our cross-chain bridging withdrawal via BNB Chain. Based on our investigations, the attackers managed to get the signature and minted 80M $WND on BNB Chain and traded through PancakeSwap for a total of 750 BNB which resulted in the sudden drop of $WND price.

> The attack was first discovered on 7 April 2022, 14:53pm (GMT+8). The team took swift actions by suspending all services for users and blocked other attacks by the hackers by disabling all WonderHero platform services and trading on listed exchanges.

> A thorough investigation will be done and details will be updated.
