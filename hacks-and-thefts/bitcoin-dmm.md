## Details

BitcoinDMM wasn't address poisoning.  The attacker maybe wanted it to look that way. Vector of this attack looks much more likely to be a private key compromise

0.1 BTC fee on the theft tx - a hot/cold transfer DMM makes would never use a $7k fee.  The attacker wanted to expedite confirmations

The theft txn was pre-constructed based on an assumption that the wallet balance would be at least 4500 BTC for a window, and each input could be as much as 500 BTC to maximize the take.

Attacker had the two required signatures for a short window of time - they probably expected it would be detected immediately.

get RAT's installed on two employees machines who each had a signing key, get their key, pre-construct the tx from analysis of the potential unspent outputs available, maximizing the take and minimizing the chance the transfer would fail because one of the inputs was already spent, bump the fee to 0.1 BTC to expedite confirmations...
