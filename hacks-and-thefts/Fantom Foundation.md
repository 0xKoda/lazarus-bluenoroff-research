# Theft from Fantom Foundation C-Level

Amount Stolen: $7,000,000

## Details:

The Fantom Foundation]], developer of the Fantom network, was hacked for over $550,000 in cryptocurrency, initially reported as $7 million by blockchain security researchers.

The foundation clarified that most of the stolen funds belonged to other users, and 99% of their own funds were secure. Some wallets mislabeled by block explorers were initially thought to belong to the foundation but were later reassigned to an employee and no longer held company funds.

The attack is under investigation to determine how the wallets were compromised.

The attack targeted the foundation and other Fantom wallet users, rather than the Fantom network itself.


## Notes

It's likely a single device or devices on a single network were compromised leading to the compromise of multiple wallets holding assets belonging to an employee of the Fantom Foundation and the Fantom Foundation wallets themselves. A total of approximately $7m was stolen in this single incident. The likely cause is, again, complete device pwnage due to DPRK malware. Most likely employee is Fantom CEO Michael Kong.

DPRK attribution comes, in part, from observations on DPRK-controlled C2s as well as on-chain laundering and timing matching other thefts that occuring the same week.
