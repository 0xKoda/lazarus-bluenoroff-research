# MNGR

Date:: October 8th, 2021

Amount Stolen:: $24,100,000


## Details

> @mgnr_io was the victim of a malicious and targeted cyber attack the attackers appear to be very sophisticated and have scripting abilities / facility with cross-chain bridging and mixing techniques

> the point of entry was likely a phishing email masked as somebody we recognized from @maplefinance and containing a fake docx from @PanteraCapital

> we've subsequently heard of 2 other crypto firms receiving an equally targeted attacks (also with 'pantera' term sheets) the intrusion was probably used to implant a key logger and steal credentials to a password manager where we had (stupidly) shared a privkey as temporary hot wallet between a few team members

> we'd typically stay a bit more private about this sort of thing but after hearing as of yesterday the attacks are ongoing feel we need to step forward for public good and in defense of other crypto money managers one framework for thinking about cybersecurity is as a 'swiss cheese' a number of holes must align in order for hackers to achieve entry

> again, please take this opportunity to revisit your own setup

> we have engaged support of law enforcement and will be aggressively pursuing the leads / clues the thieves have left behind

> we have already recovered a substantial portion of the stolen funds and have frozen some of the hackers' exchange accounts (with fake KYC)

> as a precaution we temporarily disabled some of our trading systems / wallets

> we thank all exchange / venture / trading partners for being patient during this time and can assure everyone that we'll be back up and running soon (tm)

- Some of mngr's addresses are ID'd [here](https://cryptocatvc.medium.com/mgnr-io-maple-finance-7e70241e5f4), however the author makes the fatal mistake of attributing large sweeps / dumps / closing of positions to malicious activity on mngr's part, not the hackers. rip mngr. (and shity sleuths.)
