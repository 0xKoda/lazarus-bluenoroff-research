### [üîó](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/it-only-takes-one.md) it-only-takes-one

A list of treasuries / protocols / platforms / bridges / DEX's / CEX's where the initial targetting of a single team member or private key (usually via spearphishing) resulted in the hack/theft of a much bigger thing

### [üîó](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/lazarus-background.md) background

- **really good links:** all the best articles and pieces i found bc theres a lot of really shitty blogspam out there and also a lot of deep dives into specific peices of malware that are much less prouctive to read if you dont first have the requisite background knowledge.

- **background / general analysis:** the meat of my big takeaways. trying to pull out of the depths of some of the hack and malware analysis to zoom out and organize my thoughts a bit more.

- **many, many names:** this is really just my notes as i was learning things becuase the different names and evolution of names with lazarus is SO MUCH. not sure if helpful for anyone else to read but there is is.


### [üîó](https://github.com/tayvano/lazarus-bluenoroff-research/blob/main/lazarus-evolution.md) evolution

- reports and articles and government indictments and news stories and all sorts of random stuff organized by date. it also has defi and exchange hacks that are attributed to lazarus, as well as some of the big hacks that are known to **not** be lazarus in order to provide better historical context. there's also a random assortment of various other north korean apt activtiy: bank heists, interesting quotes, spear-phishing campaigns against other industries, etc.



### purpose

no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. 

i've follow lazarus for a long, long time as they seem to be following me around. 

i had multiple irl friends who worked at sony and had their computers taken over and lives disrupted in such a crazy, unbelievable way. 

since building my own crypto product in 2015, i've studied all the big hacks and security incidents and cryptographic fuckups and phishing campaigns in order to learn from other people's mistakes, improve my products, educate the community, and ultimately build things that actually help people be successful. turns out, if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it.

today, lazarus is likely actively targetting my company, my collegues, my product, and...me.  they may already be here watching everything i do. more mind-bendingly, they have spent considerable effort creating malicious versions of my product in order to stealthily replace the legitimate program and with one that steals funds. most notably, and terrifyingly, is the case of hugh karp. realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...its just a tad bit much.

thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. üï≥Ô∏èüêá
