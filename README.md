# üëõ TraderTraitor

- The big boys, the insane laundry sessions, fake job offers usually target devs/devops

- Today: Skills tests in python, sql, etc. Personas on Linkedin usually white and impersonating/cloned legit profile. Github repos may be private. Conversation style usually more casual, conversational. More time passes between compromise and theft (at times 6+ months) making it hard to identify intiial social engineering that led to compromise.

- Before: Malicious electron trading apps 

- Ronin, Harmony, Atomic Wallet, Coinex, Coinspaid, Alphapo, Stake, HTX/Heco, Poloniex

# üéôÔ∏è Contagious Interview

- UnoReDAO, OKX Dex, ConcentricFi, Serenity Shield, Wilder World, on and on and on and on and on. Also the Upwork/Braintrust/Linkedin Job Scams. Flickthebean, etc.

- Connects af onchain‚Äîa real mess. Stargate / Defiway / RhinoFi / Railgun / Dust Collectors. 

- In the cases of protocol exploits, the private keys that have critical access are compromised and used to upgrade the protocol in order to mint an infinite amount of new tokens or drain the protocol of any locked assets. Lots of transferOwnerships.

- On the social engineering side: Developers are either contacted by the attacker, or reach out to the attacker inquiring about a job or some work. The attacker asks them to complete a job interview, skills test, or fix some issues in an existing codebase. Details about the test or code issues are often provided via Google Docs or similar text document. They have much more information and provide actual requirements, as opposed to the conversations seen used in TraderTraitor. The code is typically provided via Github, Bitbucket, or a zip file hosted on Google Drive. They are Javascript / Node JS projects and use npm install / run / build. Often the personal addresses that are active and in unlocked browser extensions or desktop wallets are drained of all assets nearly immediately. Shortly thereafter, these private keys, or additional private keys stored on the developers machine, are further drained of assets and/or used to exploit smart contracts or protocols.

- There are also cases where the attacker reaches out to a developer or dev shop or asking to hire / contract them to help finish a project. They then grant the dev shop access to a private (malicious repo). The tech lead runs the repo to see what work is required and provide a quote. That tech lead's device is thus compromised, alongside their own wallets/projects or previous clients.

- Public reporting and first-hand victim reports often make these incidents sound like a malicious employee or insider or new hire is responsible and thus leads to them being tagged as DPRK IT Workers. However, more often it is simply that an employee‚Äôs device was compromised and their access was used. The key difference in victim reports is whether they actually hired and paid. For IT Workers, often the team will have and mention resumes, payroll, etc.

# Purpose

- no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. i've follow lazarus for a long, long time

- i had multiple irl friends back in the day who worked at sony. now i have had multiple friends, founders, builders, users who have been rekt by these same fools, grown up

- if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it

- realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...and want to steal all your crypto...it's a lot

- thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. üï≥Ô∏èüêá
