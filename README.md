## Purpose

- no real purpose. i like rabbitholes, i'm weird. i've follow lazarus for a long, long time.

- i had multiple irl friends back in the day who worked at sony. now i have had multiple friends, founders, builders, users who have been rekt by these same fools, grown up.

- if you read about all the hacks and phishing campaigns in crypto, youre basically reading about lazarus, even if you dont know it.

- realizing there's guys on the other side of the world watching you...who likely know your product and codebase better than some of your own team members...guys who come from such a fundamentally different place than you do with regards to experience, ideology, motivation, and desires...and want to steal all your crypto...it's a lot.

- thus, i dive into my rabbithole for comfort. üï≥Ô∏èüêá
