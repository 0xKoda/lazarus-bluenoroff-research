# Malware 


Hereâ€™s my initial analysis of the CoreKitAgent binary - which is a new backdoor. 

When executed, CoreKitAgent performs the following tasks

- Collects basic system information

- Executes a AppleScript payload by:

    - Decrypts it from within itself

    - Saving it to /Users/<user>/Library/CoreKit/.ses 

    - Executing using osascript

- This AppleScript payload is pretty much the same as malware_script_3.scpt namely that it will poll the C2 server bots.autoupdate[.]online and if it receives a response execute it using run script. 

    - This payload has also been seen in other intrusions by this adversary

- The code also deletes a file located at /private/var/tmp/cfg which based on the filename could be a config of some sort? Unclear without access to more info. 

Since this binary essentially duplicates an earlier stage of the infection chain, my hypothesis is that it serves as a persistent backdoor the that the adversary can use to maintain remote control of the system and possibly drop additional payloads for more specific tasks (since itâ€™s unlikely the adversary would act on their objectives using such a simple backdoor).

This would also mean that it likely needs some persistence mechanism, though this sample does not deploy any, so Iâ€™d recommend the IR team to review for signs of new LaunchAgents/Login Items/crontabs etc.
