Hey there! I've heard that North Korean hackers trick freelancers by offering to download and install a program, after which cryptocurrency theft occurs. I received a message on Upwork from an empty account with an offer to join a project. They provided access to a GitHub repository. The application is on the MERN stack. I haven't installed anything and decided to ask more experienced users if there is a way to check the files. Any advice on this topic is welcome.

Please post upwork username / links / github repo / whatever they sent you. There are folks who monitor their activity closely and have comms with Upwork/Braintrust/Linkedin/Github/Atlassian to get their malicious repos taken offline to protect others (assuming its verified as malicious)

The repository is private. It appears they are preparing files for specific victims, as they sent me something that fits my stack perfectly. However, they forgot to remove the author from package.json, and I found the original GitHub account from which they stole the code. Now I'm 100% sure that this is malware. Their github acc: https://github.com/goldy1113 | upwork: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a6075dfe3645267e

is there a way for you to clone and share the original private repo?

J [6/18/24 9:22 AM]
Private or just post here? Also I can upload a zip archive

You can DM me it lol, zip is fine if that's easier for you
