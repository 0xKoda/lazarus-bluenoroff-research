### 2016-02-04: Bangledesh Bank SWIFT Heist Initiated - $81M
- The attacks were focused on banking infrastructure and staff, exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing passwords, using keyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the way banks use servers with SWIFT software installed requires personnel responsible for the administration and operation. Sooner or later, the attackers find these personnel, gain the necessary privileges, and access the server connected to the SWIFT messaging platform. With administrative access to the platform they can manipulate software running on the system as they wish. There is not much that can stop them, because from a technical perspective, their activities may not differ from what an authorized and qualified engineer would do: starting and stopping services, patching software, modifying the database.

### 2016-05-26: SWIFT Heists "Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank"
- URL:: https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=8ae1ff71-e440-4b79-9943-199d0adb43fc&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments
- Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank and attempted to steal over $1 million from the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam.
- Malware used by the group was also deployed in targeted attacks against a bank in the Philippines. In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced back as far as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, which was hitherto the earliest known incident.
- The attack against the Bangladesh central bank [triggered an alert by payments network SWIFT](https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-comments-on-malware-reports), after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers. [SWIFT issued a further warning](https://www.swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-customer-communication_customer-security-issues), saying that it had found evidence of malware being used against another bank in a similar fashion. [Vietnam‚Äôs Tien Phong Bank subsequently stated](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-cybercrime-idUSKCN0Y60EN) that it intercepted a fraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFT concluded that the second attack indicates that a ‚Äúwider and highly adaptive campaign‚Äù is underway targeting banks.
- A third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador, [was also reported to have lost $12 million to attackers](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD) using fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about the tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia.
- Symantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: [Backdoor.Fimlis](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021219-3219-99), [Backdoor.Fimlis.B](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021220-0239-99), and [Backdoor.Contopee](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99). At first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were, however code sharing between [Trojan.Banswift](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99) (used in the Bangladesh attack used to manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a connection.

### 2017-04-03: "Lazarus Under The Hood"
- https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/
- Lazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking. It has been on a spike since 2011.
- All those hundreds of samples that were collected give the impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of malware, which produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors.
- We have seen them using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting their own algorithms, applying commercial software protectors, and using their own and underground packers. 
- Lazarus knows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary backdoors being pushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn‚Äôt impact the group too much. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection they start deploying more advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk. The code is wrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container, or maybe hidden in a binary encrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only attackers can use, because they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems ‚Äì be it a public sandbox or a researcher‚Äôs environment ‚Äì will never see the real payload.
- Most of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new generation as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be newer, and newer, and newer versions. Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, same code, and the same algorithms. ‚ÄúKeep morphing!‚Äù seems to be their internal motto.
- Those rare cases when they are caught with same tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one part doesn‚Äôt always know what the other is doing.

- Nano Stolen June 2017, July 2017, October 2017, ???
- Founder hid these thefts, cashed out BTC at the top of the market, and then said "oh we got hacked of Nano just like Coincheck" in Feb 2018.
- "The checks for whether you had a sufficient balance to withdraw were only implemented as client-side JavaScript" so I guess anyone could have stolen it
- However it does sound somewhat like the BitThumb Hack that would occur in June of 2018 which was also initially suspected to be an inside job and maybe probably laz?
- Italian investigations do say the actual hackers of Nano are unknown but this is secondary point to how fraudulent the founder was generally.
- Bitgrail was a small Italian exchange trading in lesser-known cryptos, such as Nano (XRB). In February 2018, just as the price of XRB skyrocketed from a few cents to $33, the exchange was hacked. Nano wallets had been targeted with at least 17M coins stolen (the equivalent of around $150M). Many users started to comment that they had noticed issues with the exchange before the attack (significantly lower withdrawal limits and transaction problems). Investigations also revealed that the coins had been stolen from cold wallets, not hot wallets, suggesting an inside job. Investigations have continued over the last few years with Italian police recently accusing the man who owned Bitgrail to be behind the attacks (either directly involved or was aware/took no action to prevent further theft once the first attack had been carried out).

- MAR 10135536.11: North Korean Trojan: SHARPKNOT
- STIX file for MAR 10135536.11
- DHS and FBI identified a Trojan malware variant‚Äîreferred to as SHARPKNOT‚Äîused by the North Korean government. SHARPKNOT is a 32-bit Windows executable file. When executed from the command line, the malware overwrites the Master Boot Record and deletes files on the local system, any mapped network shares, and physically connected storage devices.

### 2018-04-03: "Lazarus KillDisks Central American casino"
- https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/
- Our analysis shows that the cybercriminals behind the attack against an online casino in Central America, and [several other targets](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/) in late-2017, were most likely the infamous Lazarus hacking group. In all of these incidents the attackers utilized similar toolsets, including KillDisk; the disk-wiping tool that was executed on compromised machines.
- Some of the past attacks attributed to the Lazarus Group attracted the interest of security researchers who relied on [Novetta et al‚Äôs white papers](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/resources/) with hundreds of pages describing the tools used in the attacks ‚Äì [the Polish and Mexican banks](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/); [the WannaCryptor outbreak](https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html); [phishing campaigns against US defense contractors](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/), etc ‚Äì and provides grounds for the attribution of these attacks to the Lazarus Group.
- Our analysis of these two Win32/KillDisk.NBO variants revealed that they share many code similarities. Further, they are almost identical to the KillDisk variant used against financial organizations in Latin America, as [described by Trend Micro](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/).
- One of the variants was protected using the commercial PE protector VMProtect in its 3rd generation, which made unpacking it trickier. The attackers most likely did not buy a VMProtect license but have rather used leaked or pirated copies available on the Internet. Using protectors is common for the Lazarus group: during the [Polish and Mexican attacks](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/) in February 2017, they made use of Enigma Protector and some of the Operation Blockbuster samples, [reported by](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/) Palo Alto Networks, used an older version of VMProtect.
- This recent attack against an online casino in Central America suggests that hacking tools from the Lazarus toolset are recompiled with every attack (we didn‚Äôt see these exact samples anywhere else). The attack itself was very complex, consisted of several steps, and involved tens of protected tools that, being stand-alone, would reveal little from their dynamics.
- Utilizing KillDisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes: the attackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation, or it was used directly for extortion or cyber-sabotage. In any case, the fact that ESET products detected the malware on over 100 endpoints and servers in the organization signifies a large-scale effort of the attackers.

- Sometime between 2018-01-01 and 2018-05-10
- An employee of The Exchange 1 communicated with a ‚Äúpotential client‚Äù via email which resulted in employee unwittingly downloading malware which then attacked The Exchange 1.

- Proceeds of the theft of BTC from The Exchange 1 were used to perpetuate additional schemes by paying for infrastructure, to include domain registration for websites like Celas LLC
- A specific command line in the Celas Trade Pro application and Fallchill are consistent with North Korean hacking campaigns against the financial industry dating back to 2016
- The North Korean co-conspirators who emailed The `Exchange 1` malware were also engaged in a massive phishing campaign in an attempt to infect other users with malware. To provide credibility to the online personas, fake social media profiles were created.
- The phishing emails were primarily three types: advertisements for Celas LLC; developers looking to work with/for the targeted exchange; or a prospective client. The emails often contained a link to celasllc.com or an attachment. Additionally, the Waliy Darwish LinkedIn account messaged multiple people as well.

### 2018-07-09: ‚ú® Bancor Hack - $23M
- As for users‚Äô tokens, Bancor immediately created a coalition with the instant exchange service Changelly, through which the hackers tried to withdraw funds. Transactions were frozen there as well.
- Bancor, a decentralized exchange created in opposition to centralized ones was attacked by hackers on July 9, 2018.
- Following the attack, $10 million worth of BNT was recovered from the hack.
- Hackers withdrew a total of $23.5 million (value at the time of the hack) from the exchange‚Äôs hot wallet. Tokens on the exchange were immediately frozen, which caused a flurry of criticism from the cryptocurrency community because such actions directly contradict the principle of decentralization. Charlie Lee summed up the overall view in a tweet, announcing that Bancor can manipulate users‚Äô funds:
- Wallet used to upgrade smart contracts used to steal $23M
- ‚ÄúA Bancor wallet got hacked and that wallet has the ability to steal coins out of their own smart contracts. An exchange is not decentralized if it can lose customer funds OR if it can freeze customer funds. Bancor can do BOTH. It‚Äôs a false sense of decentralization.‚Äù

### 2018-08-23: Operation AppleJeus: "Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware"
- https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/
- While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill, including [one](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-318A) from US-CERT.
- To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is apparently coming soon, according to the website. It‚Äôs probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS.
- The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms.

- The exact amount stolen in the hack is still unknown. Unfortunately for Cryptopia, they suffered from another hack 15 days after the first one. That was the end of the New Zealand-based exchange ‚Äì they are now going through the liquidation process. 2020 Update: Cryptopia is still undergoing liquidation, but it has now been revealed that the exchange was failing to meet anti-money laundering (AML) requirements when creating new user accounts. For over 900,000 active user accounts, there is no customer data beyond usernames and email addresses. 
- Less than 1% of users had completed customer identification, a vital part of AML procedures which ensures that customers are who they say they are. Thousands of accounts which held over $3 million worth of cryptocurrency were traced back to uninhabited islands or physical addresses that didn‚Äôt exist. As it stands, many of those who lost funds in the hack aren‚Äôt eligible to be refunded by liquidators because there is not enough information on who owned what accounts. "

### 2019-10-29: Indian Nuclear Power Plant Attack
- https://greatgameindia.com/kudankulam-nuclear-power-plant-hit-by-cyberattack/
- Kaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team have discovered a previously unknown spy tool, which had been spotted in Indian financial institutions and research centers. Called Dtrack, this spyware reportedly was created by the Lazarus group and is being used to upload and download files to victims‚Äô systems, record key strokes and conduct other actions typical of a malicious remote administration tool (RAT).
- In 2018, Kaspersky researchers discovered ATMDtrack ‚Äì malware created to infiltrate Indian ATMs and steal customer card data. Following further investigation using the Kaspersky Attribution Engine and other tools, the researchers found more than 180 new malware samples that had code sequence similarities with the ATMDtrack, but at the same time were not aimed at ATMs. Instead, its list of functions defined it as spy tools, now known as Dtrack.
- Moreover, not only did the two strains share similarities with each other, but also with the 2013 DarkSeoul campaign, which was attributed to Lazarus ‚Äì an infamous advanced persistence threat actor responsible for multiple cyberespionage and cyber sabotage operations.

- On or about November 27, 2019, The Exchange 3, a South Korea-based virtual currency exchange, had approximately 342,000 ETH ($48.5 million) stolen from it
- South Korean exchange suffered a massive breach when hackers made off with 342,000 ETH (valued at $51 million at the time of the hack). Rumors swirled that this was an inside job, as [the stolen crypto had allegedly been taken from Upbit‚Äôs cold wallet](https://www.hackread.com/upbit-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacked-ether-stolen/). This turned out to be a false alarm. Thankfully, Upbit promised to cover the losses.
- However, the story doesn‚Äôt end here. [The stolen crypto has been on the move](https://cointelegraph.com/news/upbit-hack-stolen-eth-worth-millions-on-the-move-to-unknown-wallets). Whoever took it has been moving it between wallets, although it is unclear what purpose this will serve. As of January 2020, [Upbit has completed a major security update](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-upbit-finishes-security-update-in-response-to-2019-hack) after a brief suspension of services.

- Main targets: defense, governmental companies, and specific employees of those companies
- We assess this to be this year‚Äôs main offensive campaign by the Lazarus group
- The infection and infiltration of target systems had been carried out through a widespread and sophisticated social engineering campaign, which included: reconnaissance, creation of fictitious LinkedIn profiles, sending emails to the targets‚Äô personal addresses, and conducting a continuous dialogue with the target ‚Äì directly on the phone, and over WhatsApp
- Upon infection, the attackers collected intelligence regarding the company‚Äôs activity, and also its financial affairs, probably in order to try and steal some money from it
- The double scenario of espionage and money theft is unique to North Korea, which operates intelligence units that steal both information and money for their country.

### 2020-09-25: ‚ú® KuCoin CEX Hack - $275M
- In September 2020, KuCoin confirmed that hackers had managed to obtain private keys to their hot wallets before withdrawing large amounts of ethereum (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), as well as Bitcoin SV (BSV), Litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Tron (TRX), and Tether (USDT). Since then, experts have suggested they have strong reason to believe that hackers in North Korea were responsible.
- We were able to attribute this hack to Lazarus Group due in part to the KuCoin hackers‚Äô use of a specific money laundering strategy Lazarus has frequently used in the past. The strategy involves sending stolen funds to mixers in structured payments of the same size ‚Äî usually an amount just below a round number in Bitcoin ‚Äî that can be higher or lower depending on the size of the total amount to be laundered. Lazarus typically waits for each payment‚Äôs output to be confirmed by the mixer before sending a new one, allowing them to minimize losses in the event the mixer fails. Once the funds are mixed, Lazarus Group then typically sends funds to OTC brokers on one of a few exchanges. The KuCoin hackers utilized this strategy for portions of the funds stolen. This, along with other pieces of evidence we‚Äôre unable to share at this time, helped us identify Lazarus Group as the culprits. Additionally, two deposit addresses to which Lazarus Group sent stolen cryptocurrency this year also received funds stolen in the Harvest Finance hack, leading to speculation that Lazarus Group may have carried out that attack as well. However, this is still unconfirmed.
- KuCoin hackers used platforms like Uniswap and Kyber to swap stolen tokens into ETH
- Chainalysis said it was able to attribute the KuCoin hack to the North Korean hacking group by looking at how the stolen funds were laundered.

### 2020-09-??: Pharma Company Espionage Attacks
- An employee of the pharmaceutical company received a document named GD2020090939393903.doc with a job offer (creation date: 2020:09:22 03:08:00).
- After a short period of time, another employee received a document named GD20200909GAB31.doc with a job offer from the same company (creation date: 2020:09:14 07:50:00). By opening the documents from a potential employer, both victims activated malicious macros on their home computers
- In one of the cases, a malicious document was received via Telegram. Note that both documents were received by the victims over the weekend.
- At the same time, by performing reconnaissance on the computers available, the attackers received new vectors for penetration into the company's corporate network. So, two days later, after the company's network infrastructure was compromised, another employee from another branch received a job offer. On the social network LinkedIn, the victim was contacted by a user named Rob Wilson, shortly after which she received an email with a job offer from General Dynamics UK.
- The compromised user also forwarded the malicious email to her colleague. However, the recipient did not open the malicious document and did not allow the attackers to expand the attack surface.
- In this campaign, attackers, under the guise of the HR service of General Dynamics Mission Systems, sent documents with malicious macros containing a stub text with a job offer through LinkedIn Messages, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.

### 2021-01-01: 2021 Chainalysis Report: North Korean Hackers Crypto Holdings Reach All-time High
- https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto-Crime-Report-2022.pdf
- North Korean cybercriminals had a banner year in 2021, launching at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400M worth of digital assets last year.
- These attacks targeted primarily investment firms and centralized exchanges, and made use of phishing lures, code exploits, malware, and advanced social engineering to siphon funds out of these organizations‚Äô internet-connected ‚Äúhot‚Äù wallets into DPRK-controlled addresses. 
- Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out. These complex tactics and techniques have led many security researchers to characterize cyber actors for the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK) as advanced persistent threats (APTs). This is especially true for APT 38, also known as ‚ÄúLazarus Group,‚Äù which is led by DPRK‚Äôs primary intelligence agency, the US- and UN-sanctioned Reconnaissance General Bureau. 
- While we will refer to the attackers as North Korean-linked hackers more generally, many of these attacks were carried out by the Lazarus Group in particular. Lazarus Group first gained notoriety from its Sony Pictures and WannaCry cyberattacks, but it has since concentrated its efforts on cryptocurrency crime‚Äîa strategy that has proven immensely profitable. 
- From 2018 on, the group has stolen and laundered massive sums of virtual currencies every year, typically in excess of $200M. The most successful individual hacks, one on KuCoin and another on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange, each netted more than $250M alone. 
- Interestingly, in terms of dollar value, Bitcoin now accounts for less than one fourth of the cryptocurrencies stolen by DPRK.
- In 2021, only 20% of the stolen funds were Bitcoin, whereas 22% were either ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. And for the first time ever, Ether accounted for a majority of the funds stolen at 58%.
- The growing variety of cryptocurrencies stolen has necessarily increased the complexity of DPRK‚Äôs cryptocurrency laundering operation. Today, DPRK‚Äôs typical laundering process is as follows:
- 1. ERC-20 tokens and altcoins are swapped for Ether via decentralized exchange (DEX)
- 2. Ether is mixed
- 3. Mixed Ether is swapped for Bitcoin via DEX
- 4. Bitcoin is mixed
- 5. Mixed Bitcoin is consolidated into new wallets
- 6. Bitcoin is sent to deposit addresses at crypto-to-fiat exchanges based in Asia ‚Äîpotential cash-out points
- In fact, we observed a massive increase in the use of mixers among DPRK-linked actors
- More than 65% of DPRK‚Äôs stolen funds were laundered through mixers this year, up from 42% in 2020 and 21% in 2019, suggesting that these threat actors have taken a more cautious approach with each passing year.
- Why mixers? DPRK is a systematic money launderer, and their use of multiple mixers is a calculated attempt to obscure the origins of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies while offramping into fiat. Why DeFi? DeFi platforms like DEXs provide liquidity for a wide range of ERC-20 tokens and altcoins that may not otherwise be convertible into cash. When DPRK swaps these coins for ETH or BTC they become much more liquid, and a larger variety of mixers and  exchanges become usable. What‚Äôs more, DeFi platforms don‚Äôt take custody of user funds and many do not collect know-your-customer (KYC) information, meaning that cybercriminals can use these platforms without having their assets frozen or their
- identities exposed.
- DPRK‚Äôs stolen fund stockpile: $170M worth of old, unlaundered cryptocurrency holdings. Chainalysis has identified $170M in current balances‚Äîrepresenting the stolen funds of 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021‚Äîthat are controlled by North Korea but have yet to be laundered through services. The ten largest balances by dollar value are listed below.
- Of DPRK‚Äôs total holdings, roughly $35M came from attacks in 2020 and 2021. By contrast, more than $55M came from attacks carried out in 2016‚Äîmeaning that DPRK has massive unlaundered balances as much as six years old.

### 2021-01-25: ‚ú®  Google TAG report on a new campaign targeting security researchers
- government-backed entity based in North Korea. Social media targetting.
- the actors established a research blog and multiple Twitter profiles to interact with potential targets. They've used these Twitter profiles for posting links to their blog, posting videos of their claimed exploits and for amplifying and retweeting posts from other accounts that they control.
- Their blog contains write-ups and analysis of vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed, including ‚Äúguest‚Äù posts from unwitting legitimate security researchers, likely in an attempt to build additional credibility with other security researchers.
- After establishing initial communications, the actors would ask the targeted researcher if they wanted to collaborate on vulnerability research together, and then provide the researcher with a Visual Studio Project. Within the Visual Studio Project would be source code for exploiting the vulnerability, as well as an additional DLL that would be executed through Visual Studio Build Events. The DLL is custom malware that would immediately begin communicating with actor-controlled C2 domains. An example of the VS Build Event can be seen in the image below.
- In addition to targeting users via social engineering, we have also observed several cases where researchers have been compromised after visiting the actors‚Äô blog. In each of these cases, the researchers have followed a link on Twitter to a write-up hosted on blog.br0vvnn[.]io, and shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on the researcher‚Äôs system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an actor-owned command and control server. At the time of these visits, the victim systems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser versions.
- These actors have used multiple platforms to communicate with potential targets, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, Keybase and email

- https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyberattacks-and
- Nigerian Instagram celebrity Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, has been named in another case in the United States, this time with North Korean hackers involved.
- The United State Justice Department said Hushpupp conspired with a Canadian-American citizen Ghaleb Alaumary and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019.
- Hushpuppi is currently facing separate trial for conspiring ‚Äúto launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe affidavit also alleges that Abbas conspired to launder funds stolen in a $14.7 million cyber-heist from a foreign financial institution in February 2019, in which the stolen money was sent to bank accounts around the world.
- Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean conspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes. Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of Georgia.
- With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators‚Äô activities, Alaumary organized teams of co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018. 
- Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka ‚ÄúRay Hushpuppi,‚Äù and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a separate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.

### 2021-04-19: ‚ú® EasyFi ‚Äì $80M - ^^v similar to Hugh Karp^^
- By stealing the private keys to EasyFi‚Äôs MetaMask admin account, hackers were able to extract $6M in USD, DAI, and USDT, plus 2.98M EASY tokens, all of which amounted to around $81M. The machine that was compromised to gain the keys was offline most of the time, only being switched on to perform official transfers for the project. When the attack was carried out, the machine had been offline for more than a week. And because it wasn‚Äôt actively used when the attack was carried out, this delayed the platform‚Äôs response and allowed the hacker to drain the assets from the protocol.
- On Monday, 19th April at 10:40:26 AM +UTC, I was informed by teammates about large transfers of EASY tokens from EasyFi official wallets to some unknown wallets on the ethereum network and polygon network. These transactions quickly brought to my attention a possible compromise of admin keys or mnemonic keys since the machine used for the purpose was not in use for at least a week and was completely offline. Quickly, responding to the event I took all the necessary precautions and actions to curtail the losses.
- Till the time I managed to get my hands on the computer, the hacker managed to get access to admin keys and remove existing liquidity to the tune of $6 million from protocol pools in USD / DAI / USDT and transfer 2.98 Million EASY tokens to this wallet address:
- While most metamask attacks phish private keys / mnemonic phrases by tricking into downloading a malicious version, this is not the case here. My computer was compromised and metamask was altered from the disk. The physical machine was not tampered with, and it seems to be the issue with some remote access as might have been previously used on Hugh Karp. From the initial investigations, it looks like hackers are extremely sophisticated and quite likely working as part of a larger group. We are continuing our investigations and shall share more information as it becomes available.
- Showing that targeting a person works just as well as targeting a system vulnerability, a hacker [targeted the founder‚Äôs](https://medium.com/easify-network/easyfi-security-incident-pre-post-mortem-33f2942016e9)computing device to get his admin keys and transfer currency to himself. The initial loss was $6M of stablecoins and $120M worth of EASY, a token native to the EasyFi project.
- The impact upon users was limited when the EASY token‚Äôs price crashed by 50% in a low-liquidity scenario, making it difficult for the hacker to sell his tokens. Moreover, the[token was upgraded](https://medium.com/easify-network/easyfi-security-incident-66c02a277a91)to ‚ÄòEZ 2.0‚Äô four days later, making the hacker‚Äôs holdings useless. In his blog, the founder Ankitt Gaur wrote that affected users would be compensated, 25% in the form of stablecoins and 75% as IOU tokens.
- EasyFi is a DeFi lending platform for digital assets, operating across three blockchains at the time of writing.

### 2021-07-14: ‚ú® Bondly Finance Hack - hacker got access to a devs password and then manipulated a smart contract from the protocol
- On Wednesday, July 14th 2021, Bondly Finance fell victim to an attack from a malicious actor (Attacker) leading to the transfer of 373,088,023 $BONDLY tokens from the Bondly Staking Rewards contract, 200,460,000 of which were used to mint zenBONDLY in a sophisticated attack on the MANTRA DAO ZENTEREST platform. The breach also extended to a number of Bondly-held wallets, which were also compromised during the attack.
- Upon initial investigation we believe the Attacker, through a well-orchestrated strategy, gained access to a password account belonging to Brandon Smith, CEO of Bondly. The password account contained a mnemonic recovery phrase for his hardware wallet, which when replicated allowed the assailant access to the $BONDLY smart contract, as well as corporate wallets that were also compromised.
- We have reached out to the bondly finance team to share information and asked them for any information which they have collected. We are currently awaiting response from them.
- The first transaction in [0xc433D50DD0614c81EE314289eC82Aa63710D25e8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc433D50DD0614c81EE314289eC82Aa63710D25e8) (bZx PrivKey Exploiter 2) was some Matic received from a wallet related to an exploit on Bondly Finance.
- Interestingly this exploit was very similar to bzx‚Äôs: the hacker got access to a devs password and then manipulated a smart contract from the protocol. More info here

### 2021-08-18: ‚ú® Liquid.com CEX Hack - Liquid hackers have continued to move expeditiously to convert assets to ETH and launder those ETH through Tornado.cash
- https://www.trmlabs.com/post/liquid-hack-the-second-time-around
- https://blog.liquid.com/warm-wallet-incident
- 107 BTC, 9M TRON, 11M XRP, $60M in ERC-20s - $91M
- Hackers obtained access to [Liquid‚Äôs hot wallet](https://www.businessinsider.in/investment/news/hackers-raided-a-japanese-crypto-exchange-and-seized-up-to-74-million-in-assets-report-says/articleshow/85452714.cms), looting Ether, Bitcoin, XRP and 66 other currencies. Ethereum-based assets accounted for over 78% of the loss.
- The hackers routed a part of their loot through decentralised platforms like UniSwap, while assets transferred to other large crypto exchanges were frozen on Liquid‚Äôs request. The Japanese exchange resumed trading after transferring unaffected funds to[cold wallets](https://blog.liquid.com/ja/20210819-important-notice), and upgrading security to implement secure vaults.
- By the end of August, Liquid had said there would be ‚Äúno impact on user balances.‚Äù To compensate users and cover their own losses, the company[raised $120M](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1430609287223693314)as a loan from the FTX crypto exchange.
- They immediately swapped stolen USDT-on-TRON to TRON within a matter of minutes using a DEX. The quick swaps may be a result of lessons learned from the Poly.Network attack, in which stolen USDT was frozen almost immediately by Tether.
- The hacker also converted ERC-20 tokens into native Ether at a rapid pace. Once converted, the hacker appears content to sit on the haul, pooling almost 15,000 ETH, worth roughly $45 million, in a single address:(`0x5578840aae68682a9779623fa9e8714802b59946`).
- It appears the hacker's ultimate goal is to convert their ETH to BTC using DeFi protocols. Where that BTC will go next is anyone's guess, but the speed and systematic strategy employed by the Liquid hackers stands in stark contrast to the Poly Network hacker's desultory efforts.
- Whoever hacked Liquid seems to have had a thorough plan in place prior to acting, and is executing that plan with ruthless efficiency.

### 2021-08-??: ‚ùå Poly Network DeFi Exploit - $610M
- An attacker exploited cross-chain relay contracts to extract Poly Network funds from three different chains: Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. The attacker ultimately returned the stolen funds.
- A ‚Äòwhite hat‚Äô hacker pulled off the largest single cryptocurrency hack this year, claiming to have done it to expose the security hole in the ‚Äòcross chain‚Äô smart contracts used by the company.
- The company went on to suspend transactions and fix the bug, even as it negotiated with the hacker and exchanges to freeze the stolen cryptocurrency temporarily. The entire stolen amount was retrieved over the course of a week, with no loss to customers. They offered a job and a reward of $500,000, which the hacker turned down, but later grumbled about getting no reward.
- Poly Network is a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to lend, borrow and trade cryptocurrencies at a profit. Smart contracts are built into a crypto token, with self-executing terms that define what the token should do under different circumstances, for example, sell to entity X at $17.99 if price falls below $18.

### 2021-10-08: ‚ú®  mgnr Hack (Google Doc / VC Email)
- @mgnr_io was the victim of a malicious and targeted cyber attack the attackers appear to be very sophisticated and have scripting abilities / facility with cross-chain bridging and mixing techniques
- the point of entry was likely a phishing email masked as somebody we recognized from @maplefinance and containing a fake docx from @PanteraCapital
- we've subsequently heard of 2 other crypto firms receiving an equally targeted attacks (also with 'pantera' term sheets) the intrusion was probably used to implant a key logger and steal credentials to a password manager where we had (stupidly) shared a privkey as temporary hot wallet between a few team members
- we'd typically stay a bit more private about this sort of thing but after hearing as of yesterday the attacks are ongoing feel we need to step forward for public good and in defense of other crypto money managers one framework for thinking about cybersecurity is as a 'swiss cheese' - a number of holes must align in order for hackers to achieve entry
- again, please take this opportunity to revisit your own setup
- we have engaged support of law enforcement and will be aggressively pursuing the leads / clues the thieves have left behind
- we have already recovered a substantial portion of the stolen funds and have frozen some of the hackers' exchange accounts (with fake KYC)
- as a precaution we temporarily disabled some of our trading systems / wallets
- we thank all exchange / venture / trading partners for being patient during this time and can assure everyone that we'll be back up and running soon (tm)

### 2021-11-05: ‚ú®  bZx DeFi Employee Hack - $55M - theft of admin keys, drain protcol, compromised computer, manipulated smart contract of protocol 
- A bZx developer was sent a phishing email to his personal computer with a malicious macro in a Word document that was disguised as a legitimate email attachment, which then ran a script on his Personal Computer. A bZx developer had his personal wallet‚Äôs private keys taken in a phishing attack. The phishing attack was similar to one that affected another user recently named ‚Äúmgnr.io‚Äù. This attack granted the hacker access to the content of the bZx Developers wallet, and also the private keys to the BSC and Polygon deployment of bZx Protocol. After gaining control of BSC and Polygon the hacker drained the BSC and Polygon protocol, then upgraded the contract to allow draining of all tokens that the contracts had given unlimited approval.
- A bZx developer was sent a phishing email to his personal computer with a malicious macro in a Word document that was disguised as a legitimate email attachment, which then ran a script on his Personal Computer. This led to his personal mnemonic wallet phrase being compromised.
- Beginning as a simple[phishing attack](https://bzx.network/blog/prelminary-post-mortem)in a Word document, the[hackers managed](https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/a-hacker-stole-more-than-55-million-in-crypto-after-a-bzx-developer-fell-for-a-phishing-attack/articleshow/87567910.cms) to access private keys of the platform and ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô the smart contracts to transfer funds away. Most losses were on the Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks, while their decentralised infrastructure saw relatively lower losses denominated in Ethereum. On finding out what was happening, the bZx platform alerted other crypto projects and exchanges to freeze the stolen cryptocurrency. The company asked the Kaspersky security firm to investigate, who believe the hackers[were the Lazarus Group](https://bzx.network/blog/post-mortem-update)with links to North Korea.
- Even as they continue tracking the funds and[working with](https://bzx.network/blog/bzx-community-update)law enforcement agencies, the community has approved a[compensation plan](https://bzx.network/blog/bzx-compensation-plan)to help those who suffered losses as a result of the hack.

### 2022-01-04: CVE-2022-0609 Earliest sighting of this particular kit

### 2022-01-13: Kapersky Report: SnatchCrypto Campaign
- https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/
- BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group‚Äôs illegal income
- Even took the long route of building fake cryptocurrency software development companies in order to trick their victims into installing legitimate-looking apps that eventually receive backdoored updates.
- Bluenoroff compromises companies through precise identification of the necessary people and the topics they are discussing at a given time.
- They stalk and study successful cryptocurrency startups
- Infiltration team's goals are to map interactions between individuals to understand possible topics of interest
- They often send emails via `sendgrid.net` to avoid Google surrounding the email with red warnings (SendGrid is email infrastructure for things like automated emails, password resets, newsletters, etc. Interestingly, [their employee's were hacked in 2015 in order to gain access to Coinbase's SendGrid account](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/04/sendgrid-employee-account-hacked-used-to-steal-customer-credentials/) )
- emails impersonated top management of the Digital Currency Group (dcg.co)
- we saw what looked like the compromise of an existing registered company and the subsequent use of its resources such as social media accounts, messengers and email to initiate business interaction with the target
- If a venture capital company approaches a startup and sends files that look like an investment contract or some other promising documents, the startup won‚Äôt hesitate to open them, even if some risk is involved and Microsoft Office adds warning messages.
- A compromised LinkedIn account of an actual company representative was used to approach a target and engage with them.
- Generally stick to CVE-2017-0199, using it again and again before trying something else
- Vuln initially allowed automatic execution of a remote script linked to a weaponized document
- Wxploit relies on fetching remote content via an embedded URL inside one of the document meta files
- An attentive user may spot something fishy is happening while MS Word shows a standard loading popup window.
- Bluenoroff shows improved opsec at this stage
- The VBA macro does a cleanup by removing the binary objects and the reference to the remote template from the original document and saving it to the same file
- This essentially de-weaponizes the document leaving investigators scratching their head during analysis.
- This actor utilized an elevation of privilege (EoP) technique in the initial infection stage
- According to our telemetry, the `word.exe` process, created by opening the malicious document, spawned the legitimate process, `dccw.exe`
- The `dccw.exe` process is a Windows system file that has auto-elevate permission
- Abusing a `dccw.exe` file is a known [technique](https://github.com/L3cr0f/DccwBypassUAC) and we suspect the malware authors used it to run the next stage malware with high privilege
- In another case, we have observed `word.exe` spawning a notepad.exe that received a malware injection and in turn spawning `mmc.exe`
- Unfortunately, the full details of this technique are unavailable due to some missing parts.
- Infection chain 1: Windows shortcut
- Has been utilizing this infection vector for a long time
- Sent an archive-type file containing a shortcut file and document to the victim
- All archives used for the initial infection vector had a similar structure
- Archive contained a document file such as Word, Excel or PDF file that was password protected alongside another file disguised as a text file containing the document‚Äôs password
- This file is in fact a Windows shortcut file used to fetch the next stage payload
- Infection chain 2: Weaponized Word document
- Another infection chain we‚Äôve seen started from a malicious Word document
- This is where the actor utilized CVE-2017-0199:Remote template injection with an embedded malicious Visual Basic Script
- In one file the remotely fetched template refers to the first stage document and reads the encoded payload from it, injecting it to the legitimate process.
- Stealing cryptocurrency
- In some cases where the attackers realized they had found a prominent target, they carefully monitored the user for weeks or months
- They collected keystrokes and monitored the user‚Äôs daily operations, while planning a strategy for financial theft.
- If the attackers realize that the target uses a popular browser extension to manage crypto wallets (such as the Metamask extension), they change the extension source from Web Store to local storage and replace the core extension component (backgorund.js) with a tampered version. At first, they are interested in monitoring transactions. The screenshot below shows a comparison of two files: a legitimate Metamask background.js file and its compromised variant with injected lines of code highlighted in yellow. You can see that in this case they set up monitoring of transactions between a particular sender and recipient address. We believe they have a vast monitoring infrastructure that triggers a notification upon discovering large transfers.

### 2022-03-24: CVE-2022-0609 Google posts update abt zero day CVE-2022-0609 - Operation Dream Job and Operation AppleJeus
- Campaigns targeting U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT, cryptocurrency and fintech industries. 
- Targeted over 250 individuals working for 10 different news media, domain registrars, web hosting providers and software vendors. The targets received emails claiming to come from recruiters at Disney, Google and Oracle with fake potential job opportunities. The emails contained links spoofing legitimate job hunting websites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter.
- Operation AppleJeus targeted over 85 users in cryptocurrency and fintech industries leveraging the same exploit kit. This included compromising at least two legitimate fintech company websites and hosting hidden iframes to serve the exploit kit to visitors. In other cases, we observed fake websites ‚Äî already set up to distribute trojanized cryptocurrency applications ‚Äî hosting iframes and pointing their visitors to the exploit kit.
- The campaign begins by sending them phishing emails purporting to be from recruiters at Disney, Google, and Oracle, offering them false employment opportunities. The emails included links to bogus job-search websites such as Indeed and ZipRecruiter. Targets who clicked on the included malicious URLs were infected with drive-by browser malware downloads. The North Korean groups were utilizing an exploit kit (1Ô∏è‚É£ CVE-2022-0609) with hidden iframes embedded into a variety of websites. The attack kit may fingerprint target devices by collecting details like user-agent and screen resolution. After that the exploit kit executes a Chrome remote code execution hack capable of bypassing the lauded Chrome sandbox to move out onto the system.
