- "On August 3, 2017, the ransom payments from the victims of the WannaCry Version 2 ransomware were transferred from the original Bitcoin addresses to other cryptocurrency addresses in a series of transactions. As with the laundering of the ransoms associated with Version 1, following the Version 2 ransoms being sent to currency exchanges, the funds were converted to Monero. At least some of those transfers used IP addresses that have been identified as exit nodes for the TOR network, and used the same browser UserAgent string, “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0.”"

- "Malware designed to mine Monero and send any mined currency to servers located at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang was analysed.38 Separately, according to another report, the Republic of Korea Financial Security Institute specifically attributed a similar cryptojacking attack on an Republic of Korea company’s computer to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea hackers.39 According to the report, the malware is believed to have generated approximately - $25,000 worth of Monero for the hackers who deployed the malware. Given the increased anonymity of Monero, it is difficult to determine the total amount of revenue that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea may be generating from such attacks. Nevertheless, this cryptojacking incident suggests the increasingly sophisticated use of cryptojacking by the Democratic Republic of Korea and its willingness to use malware to generate cryptocurrency through mining for the benefit of the regime."

- "Registered in Hong Kong on 12 April 2018, Marine Chain Platform Limited 40 was set up as a blockchain-enabled platform for vessel transactions that offered partial ownership of maritime vessels in exchange for digital tokens. According to a Member State, Marine Chain had ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and at least one company employee had links to Democratic People’s Republic of Korea cyber actors who have extorted Bitcoin from online companies. The Member State further indicated that Marine Chain’s start-up funds likely came from the extortion of cybercurrencies."

- "In terms of the company’s financial operations, Foong undertook multiple transfers on behalf of Kim from his company account in a Singaporean financial institution. Foong stated, “I would use my Singclass account (which is my business separate from Marine Chain) to make some of these payments upon receiving payments from Tony and upon Tony’s instructions to pay them. This was because the Singclass account was the only USD account that I had”. The payments into the account from Kim (in amounts ranging from - $30,000 to - $150,000) were all done through Hong Kong front companies, with a separate company used for each transaction. The payments processed by Foong through Singclass Interna tional Pte Ltd included some that appeared suspicious (see annex 29). A summary of further findings on this case is contained in annex 27.

- "In April 2018, North Korean hackers compromised an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange through an email phishing campaign. An employee of the exchange was targeted with an infected file, which the employee downloaded. This led to the theft of enormous quantities of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin, and several other altcoins. The hack totaled nearly $230 million dollars’ worth of crypto assets at then-prevailing prices. However, the exchange never publicly confirmed the hack, which likely delayed involvement from law enforcement, and might have hampered efforts to seize and return all stolen funds to the victims."

- "The same North Korean co-conspirators registered the domain “celasllc.com.” According to its website, Celas LLC, a/k/a Celas Limited, purported to offer a cryptocurrencytrading platform, called Celas Trade Pro, which could be downloaded from celasllc.com"

- "The North Korean co-conspirators who emailed The Exchange 1 malware were also engaged in a massive phishing campaign in an attempt to infect other users with malware. To provide credibility to the online personas, fake social media profiles were created. For example: a. A Twitter account was created with the name “Waliy Darwish” that made various posts related to cryptocurrency and included a link to celasllc.com; b. The same user created a LinkedIn page for “Waliy Darwish,” listing him as a business developer at Celas LLC with a bachelor’s degree from Rotterdam University."

The Taylor team also suspected the hacker attempted to launder the stolen funds by dumping the tokens on the IDEX platform. Consequently, they instructed IDEX to temporarily delist TAY tokens

- "The proceeds of the third attack on Bithumb in June 2018 were transferred through YoBit. 36 By August 2018, less than two months after the attack, the funds were sent to YoBit in a complex series of hundreds of transactions with the aim of converting and cashing out the entirety of the stolen cryptocurrency (as opposed to spending the acquired cryptocurrency directly on goods and services). The above-mentioned cases show a clear evolution from the earlier Democratic People’s Republic of Korea cyberattack on the customers of a Republic of Korea online shopping mall, Interpark, which was designed to generate foreign currency."

- According to Bithumb, the theft was caused by “unauthorized access to its online wallets.” Once the attack was recognized, Bithumb urgently disabled deposits on the platform and also began to move all coins stored in online wallets to more secure offline ‘cold’ wallets to prevent further theft.

### 2018-Jul-09: Bancor Heist Upgrades smart contracts - $23m 🇰🇵 🔑 

- At the beginning of July 2018, hackers attempted to steal $23.5 million in cryptocurrency from the ‘decentralized’ crypto exchange Bancor and got away with $13M. The attempt included $12.5 million in Ethereum along with BNT and NPXS tokens totaling $11 million. Bancor was able to block the transfer of $10M of BNT, Bancor’s native digital currency. This security breach forced the firm to shut down operations. Bancor had been one of the more high-profile Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) of 2017, raking in $153 million during its token sale event. According to Bancor, a wallet used to update some smart contracts was breached and used to withdraw the cryptocurrency.

- "According to a source familiar with the matter, Algo Capital reported to its limited partners Friday that Pablo Yabo, its CTO, had his mobile phone compromised, which allowed attackers to seize control of an Algo hot wallet he administered. As a result of the breach, roughly $1 million to $2 million in the cryptocurrencies were taken, according to an email from CEO David Garcia."

- “Exchange 10” is a U.S.-based company focused on the Algorand blockchain, which administers ALGO tokens, a form of virtual currency. On or about September 25, 2019, Exchange 10 was the victim of a theft of multiple virtual currencies in which hackers used stolen recovery seeds1 to recreate wallets owned by Exchange 10 and its partners, including “Exchange 10 - Partner 1” and “Exchange 10 - Partner 2.” (In essence, by re-creating the wallets, the hackers were able to direct the transfer of funds out of the wallets into other addresses and wallets controlled by the hackers, thereby stealing the virtual currency from Exchange 10 and its partners.) Additionally, hackers gained access to Exchange 10-owned accounts at multiple other virtual currency exchanges. In all, the security incident resulted in the theft of the following:

- The North Korean actors illegally recreated 14 ALGO addresses within wallets owned by Exchange 10 and four ALGO addresses in wallets owned by Exchange 10 - Partner 1, and sent approximately 9,612,652 ALGO (line number 1 on the above chart) to one ALGO address. The malicious actors then split up the ALGO tokens via approximately 109 transactions and sent the tokens to approximately 106 different accounts (“Defendant Property 25” through “Defendant Property 130”) held at another exchange (“Exchange 11”)
