- __August 17th, 2021__

- Volexity recently investigated a strategic web compromise (SWC) of the website of the Daily NK (dailynk[.]com), a South Korean online newspaper that focuses on issues relating to North Korea. Malicious code on the Daily NK website was observed from at least late March 2021 until early June 2021.

- __August 24th, 2021__

- This follow-up post describes findings from a recent investigation undertaken by Volexity in which the BLUELIGHT malware was discovered being delivered to a victim alongside [RokRAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rokrat) (aka [DOGCALL](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0213/)).  RokRAT is a backdoor previously attributed to use by ScarCruft/APT37, which is also known as InkySquid. It should be noted that Volexity identified some overlap between the findings discussed in this post and [this Korean-language article](https://medium.com/s2wlab/matryoshka-variant-of-rokrat-apt37-scarcruft-69774ea7bf48).






## Kaspersky: [The BlueNoroff Cryptocurrency Hunt is Still On](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)

- __January 13th, 2022__

- Related: [Lazarus Under the Hood](https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/)

- Also, we have [previously reported](https://securelist.com/cryptocurrency-businesses-still-being-targeted-by-lazarus/90019/) on cryptocurrency-focused BlueNoroff attacks. It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income. These attackers even took the long route of building fake cryptocurrency software development companies in order to trick their victims into installing legitimate-looking applications that eventually receive backdoored updates. [We reported](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/) about the first variant of such software back in 2018, but there were many other samples to be found, which [was later reported](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a) by the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) in 2021.

- Infection chain 1. Windows shortcut

- Infection chain 2: Weaponized Word document Hugh Karp Nexus Mutual

- Stealing cryptocurrency - (the Hugh Karp / Nexus Mutual Malicious MetaMask incident)

- In some cases where the attackers realized they had found a prominent target, they carefully monitored the user for weeks or months. They collected keystrokes and monitored the user’s daily operations, while planning a strategy for financial theft.

## Kaspersky: [BlueNoroff introduces new methods bypassing MoTW](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/)

- __December 27th, 2022__

- The first new method the group adopted is aimed at evading the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) flag, the security measure whereby Windows displays a warning message when the user tries to open a file downloaded from the internet. To do this, optical disk image (.iso extension) and virtual hard disk (.vhd extension) file formats were used. This is a common tactic used nowadays to evade MOTW, and BlueNoroff has also adopted it.

- In addition, the group tested different file types to refine malware delivery methods. We observed a new Visual Basic Script, a previously unseen Windows Batch file, and a Windows executable. It seems the actors behind BlueNoroff are expanding or experimenting with new file types to convey their malware efficiently.

- Updated method # 1: Tricks to evade MOTW flag

- Updated method # 2: Scripts and novel downloader






## ProofPoint: [TA444: The APT Startup Aimed at Acquisition (of Your Funds)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta444-apt-startup-aimed-at-your-funds)

- __January 25th, 2023__

- Back in its [infant interest](https://lifars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lessons-Learned-from-64-Million-Dollar-Cryptocurrency-Hack-Case-Study.pdf) with blockchain and [cryptocurrency](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug-180129.pdf), TA444 had two main avenues of initial access: an [LNK](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/how-threat-actors-are-adapting-post-macro-world)-oriented [delivery chain](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html) and a chain beginning with documents using remote templates. These campaigns were typically referred to as [DangerousPassword](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf), [CryptoCore](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CryptoCore_Group.pdf), or [SnatchCrypto](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/). In 2022, TA444 continued to use both methods, but had also tried its hand at other file types for initial access. Despite having not heavily relied on macros in previous campaigns, TA444 seemed to mirror the cybercrime landscape in the summer and fall, attempting to find additional file types to stuff its payloads into.

- In early December 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed a significant deviation from normal TA444 operations via a relatively basic credential harvesting campaigns. This sprawling credential harvesting activity is a deviation from normal TA444 campaigns, which typically involve the direct deployment of malware. In fact, this same domain was [observed serving](https://urlscan.io/result/284a064b-63bc-4e6e-aa06-21cf86b7f6fe) a TA444 [VHD containing Cur1Agent on the same day](https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1598660262751604738).

- While TA444 has experimented with new lines of production, their core families still carry the brunt of their infections. The CageyChameleon (aka [CabbageRAT](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf)) family has expanded its functionality but still operates as a victim-profiling framework, exfiltrating running processes and host information while setting up the potential to launch subsequent tooling loaded from the command-and-control server. The lure LNKs used to [initiate execution](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html) are still often titled Password.txt.lnk.

- Similarly, TA444 has stayed the course with its [infrastructure deployments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZecjABjSk&t=1343s) and document content, effectively [reusing lure iconography](https://twitter.com/h2jazi/status/1570501870954905600) in second-stage macro-laden files and [borrowing content directly](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Wikoff-Talent-Need-Not-Apply.pdf) from entities it is spoofing. First stage remote template files have adapted to not only download the second-stage macro (tracked as Astraeus by Proofpoint) but the first stage now contains an obfuscated Cardinal backdoor, as noted by [PWC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZecjABjSk&t=1343s) and [Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/).

- Security researchers have observed TA444 deploying an impressive set of post-exploitation backdoors in its history, including [msoRAT](https://vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf), Cardinal ([default.rdp](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/)), the [Rantankba suite](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/pfpt-us-wp-north-korea-bitten-by-bitcoin-bug-180129.pdf), [CHEESETRAY](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-045c), and [DYEPACK](https://content.fireeye.com/apt/rpt-apt38), as well as [passive backdoors](https://www.mandiant.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/rpt-apt38-2018-web_v5-1.pdf), [virtualized](https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/eset_wsliknkvm.pdf) [listeners](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/28/under-hood-wslink-multilayered-virtual-machine/), and [browser extensions](https://securelist.com/the-bluenoroff-cryptocurrency-hunt-is-still-on/105488/) to facilitate theft.

- Proofpoint clusters TA444 activities based on [malware lineage](https://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CryptoCore-Lazarus-Clearsky.pdf), behavioral heuristics and traits of [first-stage tooling](https://vb2020.vblocalhost.com/uploads/VB2020-Takai-etal.pdf) meant to fool targeted users, [distinctive infrastructure usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZecjABjSk&t=1343s), and [targeting of financial entities,](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html) along with other factors. Historic TA444 operations, such as the [2016 Bangladesh Bank heist](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/3-north-korean-military-hackers-indicted-wide-ranging-scheme-commit-cyber-attacks-and) and targeting of [cryptocurrency entities](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/press-release/file/1367721/download), have been [linked to the North Korean government](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-239a) by the United States.

- The United States Treasury Department [levied sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1087) against two coin mixing services, Tornado Cash and [BlenderIO](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0768), for allowing TA444 operators to launder over $120 million of cryptocurrency stolen from intrusions into various bridge and exchange entities. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation [attributed the heist of a major cryptocurrency bridge to APT38, a group which heavily overlaps with TA444](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-attribution-of-malicious-cyber-activity-posed-by-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea), where funds were later mixed in BlenderIO. This attribution underlines how reliant TA444 is on the cryptocurrency ecosystem to steal funds, create an avenue to launder them, and cash out. Recent TA444 activity highlights how willing the adversary is to adapt their methods to continue to profit from its intrusions, and [new services will like aide](https://www.cfr.org/blog/north-koreas-cryptocurrency-craze-and-its-impact-us-policy) them in their efforts, even if unintentionally.

- While we may poke fun at its broad campaigns and ease of clustering, TA444 is an [astute and capable adversary](https://www.cfr.org/blog/north-koreas-cryptocurrency-craze-and-its-impact-us-policy) that is willing and able to defraud victims for hundreds of millions of dollars. TA444 and related clusters are [assessed to have stolen](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/north-korean-hackers-have-prolific-year-as-their-total-unlaundered-cryptocurrency-holdings-reach-all-time-high/) nearly $400 million dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency and related assets in 2021. In 2022, the group [surpassed that value in a single heist](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-attribution-of-malicious-cyber-activity-posed-by-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea) worth over [$500 million](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/540-million-stolen-from-the-ronin-defi-bridge), gathering more than [$1 billion](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-crime-midyear-update-2022/) during 2022. North Korea, like other cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has [weathered the declining value of cryptocurrencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/10/politics/north-korean-hackers-crypto-currency-firms-infiltrate/index.html), but remains engaged in its efforts to use cryptocurrency as a vehicle to provide usable funds to the regime.






## Zscaler: [The Unintentional Leak: A glimpse into the attack vectors of APT37](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unintentional-leak-glimpse-attack-vectors-apt37)

- __March 21st, 2023__

- During our threat hunting research, we came across a GitHub repository which is owned by a member of the threat actor group. Due to an operational security (OpSec) failure of the threat actor, we were able to access a wealth of information about the malicious files used by this APT group along with the timeline of their activities dating as far back as October 2020.

- Recently, Sekoia shared their findings of the toolset of APT37 [here](https://blog.sekoia.io/peeking-at-reaper-surveillance-operations-against-north-korea-defectors/). In our blog, we disclose additional details which we found as a result of our in-depth investigation of the threat actor's GitHub repository.

## Mandiant: [APT43: North Korean Group Uses Cybercrime to Fund Espionage Operations](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage)

- __March 28th, 2023__

- https://mandiant.widen.net/s/zvmfw5fnjs/apt43-report

- Today we are releasing a report on [APT43, a prolific threat actor operating on behalf of the North Korean regime](https://mandiant.widen.net/s/zvmfw5fnjs/apt43-report) that we have observed engaging in cybercrime as a way to fund their espionage operations.

- Mandiant tracks tons of activity throughout the year, but we don’t always have enough evidence to attribute it to a specific group. However, as we continue to observe more activity over time and our knowledge of related threat clusters matures, we may graduate it to a named threat actor.

- Such is the case with APT43. This report represents the culmination of endless hours of research and connecting the dots across numerous Mandiant groups, and highlights collaboration with our new colleagues at Google Cloud as well. It also marks our first official graduation since Mandiant announced [APT42 in September 2022](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises).

- Dive into the report now for [in-depth analysis on APT43](https://mandiant.widen.net/s/zvmfw5fnjs/apt43-report) targeting and TTPs, examples of their campaigns and operations, and an annex of malware and indicators. Here’s a little taste of what you can expect to learn:

- **Attribution:** Mandiant has tracked this group since 2018, and APT43’s collection priorities align with the mission of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), North Korea's main foreign intelligence service.

- **Activity:** APT43 steals and launders enough cryptocurrency to buy operational infrastructure in a manner aligned with North Korea’s juche state ideology of self-reliance, therefore reducing fiscal strain on the central government.

- **Tactics:** The group creates numerous spoofed and fraudulent (but convincing) personas for use in social engineering

- **Procedures:** APT43 buys hash rental and cloud mining services to provide hash power, which is used to mine cryptocurrency to a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based association to the buyer’s original payments—in other words, they use stolen crypto to mine for clean crypto.

This was the key to starting our investigation, so a big thanks to them!






## Google TAG: [How we’re protecting users from government-backed attacks from North Korea](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-were-protecting-users-from-government-backed-attacks-from-north-korea/)

- __April 5th, 2023__

- New Threat Analysis Group reporting underscores the evolution of ARCHIPELAGO - as well as Google’s work to stop government-backed attackers

- As part of Threat Analysis Group (TAG)’s mission to counter serious threats to Google and our users, TAG has been tracking government-backed hacking activity tied to North Korea for over a decade. Today, as a follow up to [Mandiant’s report on APT43](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage), we are sharing TAG's observations on this actor and what Google is doing to protect users from this group and other government-backed attackers. Because TAG’s visibility into this actor is distinct from Mandiant’s, TAG uses the name ARCHIPELAGO to track a subset of APT43 activity.

- TAG began tracking ARCHIPELAGO in 2012 and has observed the group target individuals with expertise in North Korea policy issues such as sanctions, human rights and non-proliferation issues. These targets include Google and non-Google accounts belonging to government and military personnel, think tanks, policy makers, academics, and researchers in South Korea, the US and elsewhere.

- __April 20th, 2023__

- As recently reported by our Mandiant's colleagues, [APT43 is a threat actor believed to be associated with North Korea](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage). APT43’s main targets include governmental institutions, research groups, think tanks, business services, and the manufacturing sector, with most victims located in the United States and South Korea. The group uses a variety of techniques and tools to conduct espionage, sabotage, and theft operations, including spear phishing and credential harvesting.






## Jamf: [BlueNoroff APT group targets macOS with ‘RustBucket’ Malware](https://www.jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-apt-targets-macos-rustbucket-malware/)

- __April 21st, 2023__

- Jamf Threat Labs has discovered a macOS malware family that communicates with command and control (C2) servers to download and execute various payloads. This attribution is due to the similarities noted in a [Kaspersky blog](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-methods-bypass-motw/108383/) entry documenting an attack on the Windows side. These similarities include malicious tooling on macOS that closely aligns with the workflow and social engineering patterns of those employed in the campaign.)






## [RokRAT’S Missing Link](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/chain-reaction-rokrats-missing-link/)

- __May 1st, 2023__

- ROKRAT has not changed significantly over the years, but its deployment methods have evolved, now utilizing archives containing LNK files that initiate multi-stage infection chains. This is another representation of a major trend in the threat landscape, where APTs and cybercriminals alike attempt to overcome the blocking of macros from untrusted sources. The first sample we will discuss below was first discovered in July 2022, the same month that Microsoft began enforcing this new rule.

- First [reported](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/introducing-rokrat/) by Talos in April 2017, ROKRAT (also known as DOGCALL) has been consistently attributed to APT37.
- Originally supporting only Windows, over the years ROKRAT has adapted to other platforms, with macOS and Android versions discovered in the wild. The macOS version, also known as CloudMensis, was first [described](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/07/19/i-see-what-you-did-there-look-cloudmensis-macos-spyware/) by ESET in July 2022. Although Android versions of ROKRAT have existed for a long time, [InterLab](https://interlab.or.kr/archives/2567) and [S2W](https://medium.com/s2wblog/scarcruft-bolsters-arsenal-for-targeting-individual-android-devices-97d2bcef4ab) both introduced a newer version of ROKRAT on Android, known as RambleOn (Cumulus). All of this demonstrates that this malware is still being actively developed and distributed.






## JPCERT: [Attack Trends Related to DangerousPassword](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2023/05/dangerouspassword.html)

- __May 12th, 2023__

- JPCERT/CC has observed attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges believed to be related to [DangerousPassword attack campaign](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2019/07/spear-phishing-against-cryptocurrency-businesses.html) (also known as CryptoMimic or SnatchCrypto) continuously since June 2019. For many years, attackers have been using an attack technique of infecting targets with malware by sending shortcut files to them via email. However, it is known that they also use various other patterns of attacks to infect the targets with malware. This article will describe the DangerousPassword’s attack technique observed recently.)

- The following four attack patterns are described in this report: malicious CHM files from LinkedIn, OneNote files, virtual hard disk files, targeting macOS, sending malicious CHM files from LinkedIn.

## Jamf: [Bluenoroff’s RustBucket campaign](https://www.jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-apt-targets-macos-rustbucket-malware/)

- __May 22nd, 2023__

- Bluenoroff is a **[North Korea-nexus intrusion set](https://blog.sekoia.io/the-dprk-delicate-sound-of-cyber/)**, allegedly subordinated to RGB’s Bureau 121 tasked with **revenue generation **since at least 2015. Since 2017, Bluenoroff was observed conducting **financially-driven campaigns targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and venture capital **related entities in Europe, Asia, the U.S. and the UAE.

- Since at least **December 2022**, [Bluenoroff was observed leveraging **RustBucket**](), a Rust and Objective-C written malware **targeting macOS** running systems. This recent Bluenoroff activity illustrates how intrusion sets turn to cross-platform language in their malware development efforts, further expanding their capabilities highly likely to broaden their victimology. While other DPRK-nexus intrusion sets, including Lazarus, Kimsuky and more recently [Reaper](https://blog.sekoia.io/peeking-at-reaper-surveillance-operations-against-north-korea-defectors/) were already reported targeting macOS, it is the **first time Bluenoroff was observed targeting macOS users**, to the best of our knowledge.

- The RustBucket infection chain consists of a macOS installer that installs a backdoored, yet functional, PDF reader. The fake PDF reader then requires opening a specific PDF file that operates as a key to trigger the malicious activity.

- When opened in a classical PDF reader, the PDF document displays a message asking the user to open the document in the proper reader (i.e. the backdoored one). When opened in this reader, the PDF displays a nine pages document about a venture capital company that appears to be the printout of a legit company’s website. The fake PDF reader uses a hardcoded 100-bytes XOR key to decrypt the new content of the document and the C2 server configuration.






## [Lazarus and the tale of three RATs](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-three-rats/)

- __September 8th, 2022__

- Cisco Talos has been tracking a new campaign operated by the [Lazarus APT](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/northkorea) group, attributed to North Korea by the United States government.

- This campaign involved the exploitation of vulnerabilities in VMWare Horizon to gain an initial foothold into targeted organizations.

- Targeted organizations include energy providers from around the world, including those headquartered in the United States, Canada and Japan.

- The campaign is meant to infiltrate organizations around the world for establishing long term access and subsequently exfiltrating data of interest to the adversary's nation-state.

- Talos has discovered the use of two known families of malware in these intrusions — [VSingle](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/03/Lazarus_malware3.html) and [YamaBot](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2022/07/yamabot.html).






## JPCERT: [YamaBot Malware Used by Lazarus](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2022/07/yamabot.html)

- __June 30th, 2022__

- https://github.com/JPCERTCC/Lazarus-research/

- The YamaBot malware shared in the above research report targeted the Linux OS, but another type recently found targets Windows OS. (It is referred to as Kaos in the document, but this blog refers to it as YamaBot.) YamaBot is malware coded in Golang, with slightly different functionality between types created for each platform. In addition to YamaBot, Lazarus also created several other types of malware targeting multiple platforms, such as [VSingle](https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2021/03/Lazarus_malware3.html "VSingle"). This article covers the details of YamaBot.

## Andy Greenberg + Mandiant: [North Korea Is Now Mining Crypto to Launder Its Stolen Loot](https://web.archive.org/web/20230328150400/https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-apt43-crypto-mining-laundering/)

- __March 29th, 2023__

- https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt43-north-korea-cybercrime-espionage

- A spy group working for the Kim regime has been feeding stolen coins into crypto mining services in an effort to throw tracers off their trail.

- Today, cybersecurity firm Mandiant published a report on a prolific North Korean state-sponsored hacking group it's now calling APT43, sometimes known by the names Kimsuky and Thallium. The group, whose activities suggest its members work in the service of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau spy agency, has been primarily focused on espionage, hacking think tanks, academics, and private industry from the US to Europe, South Korea, and Japan since at least 2018, mostly with phishing campaigns designed to harvest credentials from victims and plant malware on their machines.

- Like many North Korean hacker groups, APT43 also maintains a sideline in profit-focused cybercrime, according to Mandiant, stealing any cryptocurrency that can enrich the North Korean regime or even just fund the hackers' own operations. And as regulators worldwide have tightened their grip on exchanges and laundering services that thieves and hackers use to cash out criminally tainted coins, APT43 appears to be trying out a new method to cash out the funds it steals while preventing them from being seized or frozen: It pays that stolen cryptocurrency into “hashing services” that allow anyone to rent time on computers used to mine cryptocurrency, harvesting newly mined coins that have no apparent ties to criminal activity.

- That mining trick allows APT43 to take advantage of the fact that cryptocurrency is relatively easy to steal while avoiding the forensic trail of evidence that it leaves on blockchains, which can make it difficult for thieves to cash out. “It breaks the chain,” says Joe Dobson, a Mandiant threat intelligence analyst. “This is like a bank robber stealing silver from a bank vault and then going to a gold miner and paying the miner in stolen silver. Everyone's looking for the silver while the bank robber's walking around with fresh, newly mined gold.”



## Krebs on 3CX: [Breach Was a Double Supply Chain Compromise 🇰🇵](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/)

- __April 20th, 2023__

- Researchers at ESET say this job offer from a phony HSBC recruiter on LinkedIn was North Korean malware masquerading as a PDF file.

- In late March 2023, 3CX disclosed that its desktop applications for both **Windows** and **macOS** were compromised with malicious code that gave attackers the ability to download and run code on all machines where the app was installed. 3CX says it has more than 600,000 customers and 12 million users in a broad range of industries, including aerospace, healthcare and hospitality.

- 3CX hired incident response firm **Mandiant**, which released a report on Wednesday that said the compromise began in 2022 when a 3CX employee installed a malware-laced software package distributed via an earlier software supply chain compromise that began with a tampered installer for **X_TRADER**, a software package provided by **Trading Technologies**.

- “This is the first time Mandiant has seen a software supply chain attack lead to another software supply chain attack,” reads [the April 20 Mandiant report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/3cx-software-supply-chain-compromise).

- “Eventually, the threat actor was able to compromise both the Windows and macOS build environments,” 3CX said in [an April 20 update on their blog](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/mandiant-security-update2/).

- Mandiant found the compromised 3CX software would download malware that sought out new instructions by consulting encrypted icon files hosted on **GitHub**. The decrypted icon files revealed the location of the malware’s control server, which was then queried for a third stage of the malware compromise — a password stealing program dubbed ICONICSTEALER.

- Meanwhile, the security firm **ESET** today published research showing remarkable similarities between the malware used in the 3CX supply chain attack and Linux-based malware that was recently deployed via fake job offers from phony executive profiles on LinkedIn. The researchers said this was the first time Lazarus had been spotted deploying malware aimed at Linux users.

- As [reported in a series last summer here](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/linkedin-bots/), LinkedIn has been [inundated](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/10/battle-with-bots-prompts-mass-purge-of-amazon-apple-employee-accounts-on-linkedin/) this past year by fake executive profiles for people supposedly employed at a range of technology, defense, energy and financial companies. In many cases, the phony profiles [spoofed chief information security officers at major corporations](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/fake-ciso-profiles-on-linkedin-target-fortune-500s/), and some attracted quite a few connections before their accounts were terminated.

- [Mandiant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-01/north-koreans-suspected-of-using-fake-resumes-to-steal-crypto?srnd=premium), [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta444-apt-startup-aimed-at-your-funds) and other experts say Lazarus has long used these bogus LinkedIn profiles to lure targets into opening a malware-laced document that is often disguised as a job offer. This ongoing North Korean espionage campaign using LinkedIn was [first documented](https://www.clearskysec.com/operation-dream-job/) in August 2020 by **ClearSky Security**, which said the Lazarus group operates dozens of researchers and intelligence personnel to maintain the campaign globally.






## ESET on 3CX: [Linux malware strengthens links between Lazarus and the supply‑chain attack](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/04/20/linux-malware-strengthens-links-lazarus-3cx-supply-chain-attack/)

- __April 20th, 2023__

- ESET researchers have discovered a new Lazarus Operation DreamJob campaign targeting Linux users. Operation DreamJob is the name for a series of campaigns where the group uses social engineering techniques to compromise its targets, with fake job offers as the lure. In this case, we were able to reconstruct the full chain, from the ZIP file that delivers a fake HSBC job offer as a decoy, up until the final payload: the SimplexTea Linux backdoor distributed through an OpenDrive cloud storage account. To our knowledge, this is the first public mention of this major North Korea-aligned threat actor using Linux malware as part of this operation.)

- This cyber-incident has made headlines in recent days. Initially reported on March 29th, 2023 in a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/) thread by a CrowdStrike engineer, followed by an official report by [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-detects-and-prevents-active-intrusion-campaign-targeting-3cxdesktopapp-customers/), stating with high confidence that LABIRINTH CHOLLIMA, the company’s codename for Lazarus, was behind the attack (but omitting any evidence backing up the claim). Because of the seriousness of the incident, multiple security companies started to contribute their summaries of the events, namely [Sophos](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/03/29/3cx-dll-sideloading-attack/), [Check Point](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2023/03/29/3cxdesktop-app-trojanizes-in-a-supply-chain-attack-check-point-customers-remain-protected/), [Broadcom](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/3cx-supply-chain-attack), [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/fr_fr/research/23/c/information-on-attacks-involving-3cx-desktop-app.html), and more.

- Further, the part of the attack affecting systems running macOS was covered in detail in a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle/status/1641294247877021696) thread and a [blogpost](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x73.html) by Patrick Wardle.

- On March 30th, Joe Desimone, a security researcher from [Elastic Security](https://www.elastic.co/kr/security-labs/elastic-users-protected-from-suddenicon-supply-chain-attack), was among the first to provide, in a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dez_/status/1641459372478935040) thread, substantial clues that the 3CX-driven compromises are probably linked to Lazarus. He observed that a shellcode stub prepended to the payload from d3dcompiler_47.dll is similar to AppleJeus loader stubs attributed to Lazarus by [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-048a) back in April 2021.

- On March 31st it was [being](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/3cx-mandiant-investigate-supply-chain-attack/646543/) [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/security/3cx-supply-chain-attack-big-questions-remain) that 3CX had retained Mandiant to provide incident response services relating to the supply-chain attack.

- On April 3rd, [Kaspersky](https://securelist.com/gopuram-backdoor-deployed-through-3cx-supply-chain-attack/109344/), through its telemetry, showed a direct relationship between the 3CX supply-chain victims and the deployment of a backdoor dubbed Gopuram, both involving payloads with a common name, guard64.dll. Kaspersky data shows that Gopuram is connected to Lazarus because it coexisted on victim machines alongside [AppleJeus](https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus-sequel/95596/), malware that was already attributed to Lazarus. Both Gopuram and AppleJeus were observed in attacks against a cryptocurrency company.

- Then, on April 11th, the CISO of 3CX summarized Mandiant’s interim findings in a [blogpost](https://www.3cx.com/blog/news/mandiant-initial-results/). According to that report, two Windows malware samples, a shellcode loader called TAXHAUL and a complex downloader named COLDCAT, were involved in the compromise of 3CX. No hashes were provided, but Mandiant’s YARA rule, named TAXHAUL, also triggers on other samples already on VirusTotal:






## Kaspersky: [Andariel’s silly mistakes and a new malware family](https://securelist.com/lazarus-andariel-mistakes-and-easyrat/110119/)

- __June 28th, 2023__

- Andariel, a part of the notorious Lazarus group, is known for its use of the [DTrack malware and ](https://securelist.com/andariel-deploys-dtrack-and-maui-ransomware/107063/)[Maui ransomware](https://securelist.com/andariel-deploys-dtrack-and-maui-ransomware/107063/) in mid-2022. During the same period, Andariel also actively exploited the Log4j vulnerability as reported by [Talos](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-magicrat/) and [Ahnlab](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/34461/). Their campaign introduced several new malware families, such as YamaBot and MagicRat, but also updated versions of NukeSped and, of course, DTrack.

- While on an unrelated investigation recently, we stumbled upon this campaign and decided to dig a little bit deeper. We discovered a previously undocumented malware family and an addition to Andariel’s set of TTPs.

- Andariel infects machines by executing a Log4j exploit, which, in turn, downloads further malware from the C2 server. Unfortunately, we were unable to catch the first piece of malware they downloaded, but we did see that exploitation was closely followed by the DTrack backdoor being downloaded. Meet EarlyRat






## [Github Security alert: social engineering campaign targets technology industry employees](https://github.blog/2023-07-18-security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/)

- __July 18th, 2023__

- [https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a)

- [https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/](https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/)

- Jade Sleet impersonates a developer or recruiter by creating one or more fake persona accounts on GitHub and other social media providers. Thus far, we have identified fake personas that operated on LinkedIn, Slack, and Telegram. In some cases these are fake personas; in other cases, they use legitimate accounts that have been taken over by Jade Sleet. The actor may initiate contact on one platform and then attempt to move the conversation to another platform.

- After establishing contact with a target, the threat actor invites the target to collaborate on a GitHub repository and convinces the target to clone and execute its contents. The GitHub repository may be public or private. The GitHub repository contains software that includes malicious npm dependencies. Some software themes used by the threat actor include media players and cryptocurrency trading tools.

- The malicious npm packages act as first-stage malware that downloads and executes second-stage malware on the victim’s machine. Domains used for the second-stage download are [listed below](#domains).

- The threat actor often publishes their malicious packages only when they extend a fraudulent repository invitation, minimizing the exposure of the new malicious package to scrutiny.

- In some cases, the actor may deliver the malicious software directly on a messaging or file sharing platform, bypassing the repository invitation/clone step.






## Sentinel One: [JumpCloud Intrusion to North Korean APT Activity](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/jumpcloud-intrusion-attacker-infrastructure-links-compromise-to-north-korean-apt-activity/)

- __July 20th, 2023__

- In recent news, the cloud-based IT management service JumpCloud publicly shared details gathered from the investigation into an intrusion on their network. Alongside [the updated details](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/security-update-incident-details), the organization shared a [list of associated indicators of compromise](https://jumpcloud.com/support/july-2023-iocs) (IOCs), noting attribution to an unnamed “sophisticated nation-state sponsored threat actor”.

- Reviewing the newly released indicators of compromise, we associate the cluster of threat activity to a North Korean state sponsored APT. The IOCs are linked to a wide variety of activity we attribute to DPRK, overall centric to the supply chain targeting approach seen in [previous campaigns](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/smoothoperator-ongoing-campaign-trojanizes-3cx-software-in-software-supply-chain-attack/).

- It is evident that North Korean threat actors are continuously adapting and exploring novel methods to infiltrate targeted networks. The JumpCloud intrusion serves as a clear illustration of their inclination towards supply chain targeting, which yields a multitude of potential subsequent intrusions. The DPRK demonstrates a profound understanding of the benefits derived from meticulously selecting high-value targets as a pivot point to conduct supply chain attacks into fruitful networks.






## Phylum: [Sophisticated Ongoing Supply Chain Attack on NPM 🇰🇵](https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/)

- __June 23rd, 2023__

- On June 11, Phylum’s automated risk detection platform alerted us to a peculiar pattern of publications on NPM. The packages in question seem to be published in pairs, each pair working in unison to fetch additional resources which are subsequently decoded and/or executed. At the time of this writing, we have yet to fully unravel the mystery, but we invite you to follow along as we share the discoveries we’ve made so far.

- The attack chain starts in the `package.json` file with a simple `preinstall` hook that looks something like this...






## JumpCloud: [Incident Details](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/security-update-incident-details)

- __July 12th, 2023__

- On July 12 in our original blog post on our recent security incident, we said we would update you periodically on new developments. We are now able to share additional details.

- First, we can confirm that CrowdStrike is our incident response partner. We can also report that we identified and CrowdStrike confirmed the nation-state actor involved was North Korea. Importantly, fewer than 5 JumpCloud customers were impacted and fewer than 10 devices total were impacted, out of more than 200,000 organizations who rely on the JumpCloud platform for a variety of identity, access, security, and management functions. All impacted customers have been notified directly.






## Phylum: [JumpCloud / NPM Attack Attributed to North Korea](https://blog.phylum.io/junes-sophisticated-npm-attack-attributed-to-north-korea/)

- __July 22nd, 2023__

- In June 2023, Phylum [was the first to unearth](https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/) a series of suspicious npm publications belonging to what appeared to be a highly targeted attack. The identified packages, published in pairs, required installation in a specific sequence, subsequently retrieving a token that facilitated the download of a final malicious payload from a remote server. A recent [security alert from GitHub](https://github.blog/2023-07-18-security-alert-social-engineering-campaign-targets-technology-industry-employees/?ref=blog.phylum.io) publicly attributes this cyber-attack—which they were investigating independently—to threat actors with strong ties to North Korean objectives. In this article, we delve deeper into the context of this attack, while also unveiling novel information uncovered by Phylum since our initial publication.






## Mandiant on JumpCloud: [North Korea Leverages SaaS Provider in a Targeted Supply Chain Attack](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/north-korea-supply-chain)

- __July 24th, 2023__

- In July 2023, Mandiant Consulting responded to a supply chain compromise affecting a US-based software solutions entity. We believe the compromise ultimately began as a result of a sophisticated spear phishing campaign aimed at JumpCloud, a zero-trust directory platform service used for identity and access management. JumpCloud reported this unauthorized access impacted fewer than five customers and less than 10 devices.The details in this blog post are based on Mandiant’s investigation into the attack against one of JumpCloud’s impacted customers.

- Mandiant attributed these intrusions to UNC4899, a Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus actor, with a history of targeting companies within the cryptocurrency vertical. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused element within the DPRK's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). Based on reporting from trusted partners, UNC4899 likely corresponds to [TraderTraitor](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-108a), a financially motivated DPRK threat group that primarily targets blockchain-related companies.

- On June 27, 2023, at 18:51:57 UTC, Mandiant identified a malicious Ruby script executed via the JumpCloud agent at a downstream customer (a software solutions entity). JumpCloud confirmed the commands framework was used for malicious data injections in their [security incident disclosure](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/security-update-incident-details). The contents and functionalities of this script are outlined below in the Backdoor Payloads section.






## Reversing Labs: [More malicious npm packages found in wake of JumpCloud supply chain hack](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/more-malicious-npm-packages-found-in-wake-of-jumpcloud-supply-chain-hack)

- __July 27th, 2023__

- Two weeks after the IT management firm JumpCloud announced that it was the victim of a supply chain attack aimed at a small population of customers in the cryptocurrency industry, an investigation by ReversingLabs researchers has uncovered evidence of more malicious npm packages, with links to the same infrastructure that also appear to target cryptocurrency providers.

- Specifically, ReversingLabs identified a number of additional npm packages with links to the same malicious campaign. One, named __btc-api-node__, was uploaded to npm on July 11th and has links to a supply chain attack first[ identified by the firm Phylum on June 23](https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/),[🔗](https://blog.phylum.io/sophisticated-ongoing-attack-discovered-on-npm/) and that was cited as a possible [precursor to the JumpCloud attack](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/jumpcloud-intrusion-attacker-infrastructure-links-compromise-to-north-korean-apt-activity/), ReversingLabs Reverse Engineer Karlo Zanki said. Phylum has since [published an additional blog post that called out the __btc-api-node __package](https://blog.phylum.io/junes-sophisticated-npm-attack-attributed-to-north-korea/) and others.






## ATT&CKcon: [Deep Dive into the Lazarus Group's Foray into macOS](https://www.slideshare.net/MITREATTACK/exploring-the-labyrinth-deep-dive-into-the-lazarus-groups-foray-into-macos)

- __October 29th, 2023__

- This talk will deep dive into the interactive macOS intrusions Crowdstrike has attributed to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. We will delve into the adversary's macOS tradecraft, techniques to circumvent existing OS protections, and social engineering tactics, while showcasing how their mechanisms and tooling map to the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain, featuring some newly proposed MITRE techniques related to the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) database.






## Elastic Security: [DPRK passing out KANDYKORN](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-catches-dprk-passing-out-kandykorn)

- __October 31st, 2023__

- Elastic Security Labs exposes an attempt by the DPRK to infect blockchain engineers with novel macOS malware.

- Threat actors lured blockchain engineers with a Python application to gain initial access to the environment

- This intrusion involved multiple complex stages that each employed deliberate defense evasion techniques

- The intrusion set was observed on a macOS system where an adversary attempted to load binaries into memory, which is atypical of macOS intrusions






## Jamf: [BlueNoroff strikes again with new macOS malware](https://www.jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-strikes-again-with-new-macos-malware/)

- __November 6th, 2023__

- Jamf Threat Labs discovered a new later-stage malware variant from BlueNoroff that shares characteristics with their RustBucket campaign. Read this blog to learn more about this malware and view the indicators of compromise.

- The malware is written in Objective-C and operates as a very simple remote shell that executes shell commands sent from the attacker server. Although it is not entirely clear how initial access was achieved, this malware is likely being used as a later stage to manually run commands after compromising a system. This malware at a glance is very different from the previously mentioned RustBucket malware seen used in other attacks, but the attacker’s focus in both cases seems to be providing simple remote shell capability.






## Palo Alto: [Hacking Employers and Seeking Employment: Two Job-Related Campaigns Bear Hallmarks of North Korean Threat Actors](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/)

- __November 21st, 2023__

The threat actor attempts to infect software developers with malware through a fictitious job interview. We originally discovered Contagious Interview through customer telemetry, and our research indicates it started as early as December 2022. Some of the infrastructure supporting this campaign remains active, and this activity remains a consistent threat. The first campaign's objective is likely cryptocurrency theft and using compromised targets as a staging environment for additional attacks. We track Contagious Interview as CL-STA-0240.

While pivoting on indicators from Contagious Interview, we discovered exposed files on a different threat actor-controlled infrastructure. These files indicate fraudulent job-seeking activity targeting a wide variety of United States (US) companies. This trove of information includes resumes with different technical skill sets and multiple identities impersonating individuals from various nations. It also includes common job interview questions and answers, scripts for interviews and downloaded job postings from US companies. We call this separate campaign "Wagemole" and track it as CL-STA-0241.






## Microsoft: [Diamond Sleet supply chain compromise distributes a modified CyberLink installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/22/diamond-sleet-supply-chain-compromise-distributes-a-modified-cyberlink-installer/)

- __November 22nd, 2023__

- Microsoft has observed suspicious activity associated with the modified CyberLink installer file as early as October 20, 2023. The malicious file has been seen on over 100 devices in multiple countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. While Microsoft has not yet identified hands-on-keyboard activity carried out after compromise via this malware, the group has historically:

- If these criteria are not met, the executable continues running the CyberLink software and abandons further execution of malicious code. Otherwise, the software attempts to contact one of three URLs to download the second-stage payload embedded inside a file masquerading as a PNG file using the static User-Agent ‘Microsoft Internet Explorer’

- When invoked, the in-memory executable attempts to contact the following callbacks for further instruction. Both domains are legitimate but have been compromised by Diamond Sleet.






## Bleeping Computer: MagicLine4NX - [UK and South Korea: Hackers use zero-day in supply-chain attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-and-south-korea-hackers-use-zero-day-in-supply-chain-attack/)

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) warn that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group breaches companies using a zero-day vulnerability in the MagicLine4NX software to conduct supply-chain attacks.

MagicLine4NX is a security authentication software developed by the South Korean company Dream Security, used for secure logins in organizations.

According to the joint cybersecurity advisory, the DPRK-based threat actors leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in the product to breach their targets, primarily South Korean institutions.
