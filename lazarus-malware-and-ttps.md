### 2014-11-24: Sony Pictures Hack Wiper Attack Occurs
- Sony Pictures Entertainment (“SPE”) and its comedic film “The Interview,” which depicted a fictional Kim Jong-Un, the Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the “supreme leader” of North Korea
- Lazarus targeted individuals and entities associated with the production of “The Interview” and employees of SPE, sending them malware that the subjects used to gain unauthorized access to Sony's network
- Once inside Sony's network, the subjects stole movies and other confidential information, and then effectively rendered thousands of computers inoperable
- The same group of subjects also targeted individuals associated with the release of “The Interview,” among other victims.
- Perpetrators identified themselves as the Guardians of Peace. 
- Large amounts of data were stolen and slowly leaked in the days following the attack.
- U.S. investigators say the culprits spent at least two months copying critical files
- The attack was conducted using malware. Server Message Block Worm Tool to conduct attacks
- Components of the attack included a listening implant, backdoor, proxy tool, destructive hard drive tool, and destructive target cleaning tool
- The components clearly suggest an intent to gain repeated entry, extract information, and be destructive, as well as remove evidence of the attack
- November 24, 2014 - malware previously installed rendered many Sony employees' computers inoperable by the software, with the warning by a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace, along with a portion of the confidential data taken during the hack.
- Several Sony-related Twitter accounts were also taken over
- Park was a North Korean hacker that worked for the country's [Reconnaissance General Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_General_Bureau), the equivalent of the

### 2014-2015: Operation Red Dot against South Korean Govt/Defence Co's
- Variants of the malware used in the Sony Pictures hack were found in attacks which targeted the websites of North Korean research and governmental organizations, and the South Korean defence industry. 
- AhnLab refers to these attacks – which occurred from 2014 to 2015 – as Operation Red Dot. The variants in this operation share similar code and names, such as AdobeArm.exe and msnconf.exe.
- The main infection methods are: executable files disguised as document files (HWP, PDF), disguised installers, and exploits of Hangul Word Processor (HWP) file vulnerabilities.
- The document files, which are listed in Table 3, are decoys disguised as legitimate documents, such as address books, deposit slips and invitations to lure victims into opening them.

### 2016-02-01: Sony Pictures Hack Report Released: Operation Blockbuster
- Joint, two-year-long effort between Kaspersky Lab, AlienVault, Symantec, Invincea, ThreatConnect, Volexity, and PunchCyber
- https://operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Report.pdf

### 2016-02-04: Bangledesh Bank SWIFT Heist Initiated - $81M
- The attacks were focused on banking infrastructure and staff, exploiting vulnerabilities in commonly used software or websites, bruteforcing passwords, using keyloggers and elevating privileges. However, the way banks use servers with SWIFT software installed requires personnel responsible for the administration and operation. Sooner or later, the attackers find these personnel, gain the necessary privileges, and access the server connected to the SWIFT messaging platform. With administrative access to the platform they can manipulate software running on the system as they wish. There is not much that can stop them, because from a technical perspective, their activities may not differ from what an authorized and qualified engineer would do: starting and stopping services, patching software, modifying the database.

### 2016-05-26: SWIFT Heists Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank
- https://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=8ae1ff71-e440-4b79-9943-199d0adb43fc&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments
- Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank and attempted to steal over $1 million from the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam.
- Malware used by the group was also deployed in targeted attacks against a bank in the Philippines. In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced back as far as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, which was hitherto the earliest known incident.
- The attack against the Bangladesh central bank [triggered an alert by payments network SWIFT](https://swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-comments-on-malware-reports), after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers. [SWIFT issued a further warning](https://swift.com/insights/press-releases/swift-customer-communication_customer-security-issues), saying that it had found evidence of malware being used against another bank in a similar fashion. [Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank subsequently stated](https://reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-cybercrime-idUSKCN0Y60EN) that it intercepted a fraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFT concluded that the second attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive campaign” is underway targeting banks.
- A third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador, [was also reported to have lost $12 million to attackers](https://reuters.com/article/us-cyber-heist-swift-specialreport-idUSKCN0YB0DD) using fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about the tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia.
- Symantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: [Backdoor.Fimlis](https://symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021219-3219-99), [Backdoor.Fimlis.B](https://symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021220-0239-99), and [Backdoor.Contopee](https://symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021515-4543-99). At first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were, however code sharing between [Trojan.Banswift](https://symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-042523-1230-99) (used in the Bangladesh attack used to manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a connection.

### 2016: Stole more than 200GB of South Korean Army data
- which included documents known as Operational Plan 5015—a detailed analysis of how a war with the country’s northern neighbor might proceed, and, notably, a plot to “decapitate” North Korea by assassinating Kim Jong Un. The breach was so egregious that Kim Tae-woo, a former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a think tank in Seoul, [told](https://ft.com/content/d8bbceb0-ad64-11e7-aab9-abaa44b1e130) the Financial Times, “Part of my mind hopes the South Korean military intentionally leaked the classified documents to the North with the intention of having a second strategy.”




# 2017

### 2017-04-03: Lazarus Under The Hood
- Lazarus is not just another APT actor. The scale of the Lazarus operations is shocking. It has been on a spike since 2011.
- All those hundreds of samples that were collected give the impression that Lazarus is operating a factory of malware, which produces new samples via multiple independent conveyors.
- We have seen them using various code obfuscation techniques, rewriting their own algorithms, applying commercial software protectors, and using their own and underground packers. 
- Lazarus knows the value of quality code, which is why we normally see rudimentary backdoors being pushed during the first stage of infection. Burning those doesn’t impact the group too much. However, if the first stage backdoor reports an interesting infection they start deploying more advanced code, carefully protecting it from accidental detection on disk. The code is wrapped into a DLL loader or stored in an encrypted container, or maybe hidden in a binary encrypted registry value. It usually comes with an installer that only attackers can use, because they password protect it. It guarantees that automated systems – be it a public sandbox or a researcher’s environment – will never see the real payload.
- Most of the tools are designed to be disposable material that will be replaced with a new generation as soon as they are burnt. And then there will be newer, and newer, and newer versions. Lazarus avoids reusing the same tools, same code, and the same algorithms. “Keep morphing!” seems to be their internal motto.
- Those rare cases when they are caught with same tools are operational mistakes, because the group seems to be so large that one part doesn’t always know what the other is doing.

### 2018-04-03: Lazarus KillDisks Central American casino
- https://welivesecurity.com/2018/04/03/lazarus-killdisk-central-american-casino/
- Our analysis shows that the cybercriminals behind the attack against an online casino in Central America, and [several other targets](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/) in late-2017, were most likely the infamous Lazarus hacking group. In all of these incidents the attackers utilized similar toolsets, including KillDisk; the disk-wiping tool that was executed on compromised machines.
- Some of the past attacks attributed to the Lazarus Group attracted the interest of security researchers who relied on [Novetta et al’s white papers](https://operationblockbuster.com/resources/) with hundreds of pages describing the tools used in the attacks – [the Polish and Mexican banks](https://welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/); [the WannaCryptor outbreak](https://malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html); [phishing campaigns against US defense contractors](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/), etc – and provides grounds for the attribution of these attacks to the Lazarus Group.
- Our analysis of these two Win32/KillDisk.NBO variants revealed that they share many code similarities. Further, they are almost identical to the KillDisk variant used against financial organizations in Latin America, as [described by Trend Micro](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-killdisk-variant-hits-financial-organizations-in-latin-america/).
- One of the variants was protected using the commercial PE protector VMProtect in its 3rd generation, which made unpacking it trickier. The attackers most likely did not buy a VMProtect license but have rather used leaked or pirated copies available on the Internet. Using protectors is common for the Lazarus group: during the [Polish and Mexican attacks](https://welivesecurity.com/2017/02/16/demystifying-targeted-malware-used-polish-banks/) in February 2017, they made use of Enigma Protector and some of the Operation Blockbuster samples, [reported by](https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/08/unit42-blockbuster-saga-continues/) Palo Alto Networks, used an older version of VMProtect.
- This recent attack against an online casino in Central America suggests that hacking tools from the Lazarus toolset are recompiled with every attack (we didn’t see these exact samples anywhere else). The attack itself was very complex, consisted of several steps, and involved tens of protected tools that, being stand-alone, would reveal little from their dynamics.
- Utilizing KillDisk in the attack scenario most likely served one of two purposes: the attackers covering their tracks after an espionage operation, or it was used directly for extortion or cyber-sabotage. In any case, the fact that ESET products detected the malware on over 100 endpoints and servers in the organization signifies a large-scale effort of the attackers.

- Kaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team have discovered a previously unknown spy tool, which had been spotted in Indian financial institutions and research centers. Called Dtrack, this spyware reportedly was created by the Lazarus group and is being used to upload and download files to victims’ systems, record key strokes and conduct other actions typical of a malicious remote administration tool (RAT).
- In 2018, Kaspersky researchers discovered ATMDtrack – malware created to infiltrate Indian ATMs and steal customer card data. Following further investigation using the Kaspersky Attribution Engine and other tools, the researchers found more than 180 new malware samples that had code sequence similarities with the ATMDtrack, but at the same time were not aimed at ATMs. Instead, its list of functions defined it as spy tools, now known as Dtrack.
- Moreover, not only did the two strains share similarities with each other, but also with the 2013 DarkSeoul campaign, which was attributed to Lazarus – an infamous advanced persistence threat actor responsible for multiple cyberespionage and cyber sabotage operations.

- Upon infection, the attackers collected intelligence regarding the company’s activity, and also its financial affairs, probably in order to try and steal some money from it
- The double scenario of espionage and money theft is unique to North Korea, which operates intelligence units that steal both information and money for their country.

- In one of the cases, a malicious document was received via Telegram. Note that both documents were received by the victims over the weekend.
- At the same time, by performing reconnaissance on the computers available, the attackers received new vectors for penetration into the company's corporate network. So, two days later, after the company's network infrastructure was compromised, another employee from another branch received a job offer. On the social network LinkedIn, the victim was contacted by a user named Rob Wilson, shortly after which she received an email with a job offer from General Dynamics UK.
- The compromised user also forwarded the malicious email to her colleague. However, the recipient did not open the malicious document and did not allow the attackers to expand the attack surface.
- In this campaign, attackers, under the guise of the HR service of General Dynamics Mission Systems, sent documents with malicious macros containing a stub text with a job offer through LinkedIn Messages, Telegram, WhatsApp, and corporate email.

# 2021

### 2021-01-01: 2021 Chainalysis Report: North Korean Hackers Crypto Holdings Reach All-time High
- https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto-Crime-Report-2022.pdf
- North Korean cybercriminals had a banner year in 2021, launching at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400M worth of digital assets last year.
- These attacks targeted primarily investment firms and centralized exchanges, and made use of phishing lures, code exploits, malware, and advanced social engineering to siphon funds out of these organizations’ internet-connected “hot” wallets into DPRK-controlled addresses. 
- Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out. These complex tactics and techniques have led many security researchers to characterize cyber actors for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as advanced persistent threats (APTs). This is especially true for APT 38, also known as “Lazarus Group,” which is led by DPRK’s primary intelligence agency, the US- and UN-sanctioned Reconnaissance General Bureau. 
- While we will refer to the attackers as North Korean-linked hackers more generally, many of these attacks were carried out by the Lazarus Group in particular. Lazarus Group first gained notoriety from its Sony Pictures and WannaCry cyberattacks, but it has since concentrated its efforts on cryptocurrency crime—a strategy that has proven immensely profitable. 
- From 2018 on, the group has stolen and laundered massive sums of virtual currencies every year, typically in excess of $200M. The most successful individual hacks, one on KuCoin and another on an unnamed cryptocurrency exchange, each netted more than $250M alone. 
- Interestingly, in terms of dollar value, Bitcoin now accounts for less than one fourth of the cryptocurrencies stolen by DPRK.
- In 2021, only 20% of the stolen funds were Bitcoin, whereas 22% were either ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. And for the first time ever, Ether accounted for a majority of the funds stolen at 58%.
- The growing variety of cryptocurrencies stolen has necessarily increased the complexity of DPRK’s cryptocurrency laundering operation. Today, DPRK’s typical laundering process is as follows:
- More than 65% of DPRK’s stolen funds were laundered through mixers this year, up from 42% in 2020 and 21% in 2019, suggesting that these threat actors have taken a more cautious approach with each passing year.
- Why mixers? DPRK is a systematic money launderer, and their use of multiple mixers is a calculated attempt to obscure the origins of their ill-gotten cryptocurrencies while offramping into fiat. Why DeFi? DeFi platforms like DEXs provide liquidity for a wide range of ERC-20 tokens and altcoins that may not otherwise be convertible into cash. When DPRK swaps these coins for ETH or BTC they become much more liquid, and a larger variety of mixers and  exchanges become usable. What’s more, DeFi platforms don’t take custody of user funds and many do not collect know-your-customer (KYC) information, meaning that cybercriminals can use these platforms without having their assets frozen or their
- DPRK’s stolen fund stockpile: $170M worth of old, unlaundered cryptocurrency holdings. Chainalysis has identified $170M in current balances—representing the stolen funds of 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021—that are controlled by North Korea but have yet to be laundered through services. The ten largest balances by dollar value are listed below.
- Of DPRK’s total holdings, roughly $35M came from attacks in 2020 and 2021. By contrast, more than $55M came from attacks carried out in 2016—meaning that DPRK has massive unlaundered balances as much as six years old.

### 2021-01-25: Google TAG report on a new campaign targeting security researchers
- government-backed entity based in North Korea. Social media targetting.
- the actors established a research blog and multiple Twitter profiles to interact with potential targets. They've used these Twitter profiles for posting links to their blog, posting videos of their claimed exploits and for amplifying and retweeting posts from other accounts that they control.
- Their blog contains write-ups and analysis of vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed, including “guest” posts from unwitting legitimate security researchers, likely in an attempt to build additional credibility with other security researchers.
- After establishing initial communications, the actors would ask the targeted researcher if they wanted to collaborate on vulnerability research together, and then provide the researcher with a Visual Studio Project. Within the Visual Studio Project would be source code for exploiting the vulnerability, as well as an additional DLL that would be executed through Visual Studio Build Events. The DLL is custom malware that would immediately begin communicating with actor-controlled C2 domains. An example of the VS Build Event can be seen in the image below.
- In addition to targeting users via social engineering, we have also observed several cases where researchers have been compromised after visiting the actors’ blog. In each of these cases, the researchers have followed a link on Twitter to a write-up hosted on blog.br0vvnn[.]io, and shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on the researcher’s system and an in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an actor-owned command and control server. At the time of these visits, the victim systems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser versions.
- These actors have used multiple platforms to communicate with potential targets, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, Discord, Keybase and email

- Nigerian Instagram celebrity Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, has been named in another case in the United States, this time with North Korean hackers involved.
- The United State Justice Department said Hushpupp conspired with a Canadian-American citizen Ghaleb Alaumary and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019.
- Hushpuppi is currently facing separate trial for conspiring “to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.”
- “The affidavit also alleges that Abbas conspired to launder funds stolen in a $14.7 million cyber-heist from a foreign financial institution in February 2019, in which the stolen money was sent to bank accounts around the world.
- Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean conspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge, which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes. Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia.
- With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators’ activities, Alaumary organized teams of co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained through ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018. 
- Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka “Ray Hushpuppi,” and others to launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in February 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a separate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC frauds and other scams.

### 2022-03-24: CVE-2022-0609 Google posts update abt zero day CVE-2022-0609 - Operation Dream Job and Operation AppleJeus
- Campaigns targeting U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT, cryptocurrency and fintech industries. 
- Targeted over 250 individuals working for 10 different news media, domain registrars, web hosting providers and software vendors. The targets received emails claiming to come from recruiters at Disney, Google and Oracle with fake potential job opportunities. The emails contained links spoofing legitimate job hunting websites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter.
- Operation AppleJeus targeted over 85 users in cryptocurrency and fintech industries leveraging the same exploit kit. This included compromising at least two legitimate fintech company websites and hosting hidden iframes to serve the exploit kit to visitors. In other cases, we observed fake websites — already set up to distribute trojanized cryptocurrency applications — hosting iframes and pointing their visitors to the exploit kit.
- The campaign begins by sending them phishing emails purporting to be from recruiters at Disney, Google, and Oracle, offering them false employment opportunities. The emails included links to bogus job-search websites such as Indeed and ZipRecruiter. Targets who clicked on the included malicious URLs were infected with drive-by browser malware downloads. The North Korean groups were utilizing an exploit kit (1️⃣ CVE-2022-0609) with hidden iframes embedded into a variety of websites. The attack kit may fingerprint target devices by collecting details like user-agent and screen resolution. After that the exploit kit executes a Chrome remote code execution hack capable of bypassing the lauded Chrome sandbox to move out onto the system.

### 2023-05-23: North Korea is now Mining Crypto to Launder Its Stolen Loot
- Today, cybersecurity firm Mandiant published a report on a prolific North Korean state-sponsored hacking group it's now calling APT43, sometimes known by the names Kimsuky and Thallium. The group, whose activities suggest its members work in the service of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau spy agency, has been primarily focused on espionage, hacking think tanks, academics, and private industry from the US to Europe, South Korea, and Japan since at least 2018, mostly with phishing campaigns designed to harvest credentials from victims and plant malware on their machines.
- Like many North Korean hacker groups, APT43 also maintains a sideline in profit-focused cybercrime, according to Mandiant, stealing any cryptocurrency that can enrich the North Korean regime or even just fund the hackers' own operations. And as regulators worldwide have tightened their grip on exchanges and laundering services that thieves and hackers use to cash out criminally tainted coins, APT43 appears to be trying out a new method to cash out the funds it steals while preventing them from being seized or frozen: It pays that stolen cryptocurrency into “hashing services” that allow anyone to rent time on computers used to mine cryptocurrency, harvesting newly mined coins that have no apparent ties to criminal activity.

### 2023-06-06: Kimsuky - Kimsuky Strikes Again | New Social Engineering Campaign Aims to Steal Credentials and Gather Strategic Intelligence

Kimsuky also engaged in extensive email correspondence and used spoofed URLs, websites imitating legitimate web platforms and Office documents weaponized with the ReconShark malware. The activity indicates Kimsuky’s growing dedication to social engineering and highlights the group’s increasing interest in gathering strategic intelligence.

### 2023-09-07: Active North Korean campaign targeting security researchers
- In January 2021, a DPRK cyber actor campaign was publicly disclosed, in which they used 0-day exploits to target security researchers working on vulnerability research and development. Over the past two and a half years, the campaign has continued. Recently, DPRK cyber actors were found to likely be responsible for a new, similar campaign, with at least one actively exploited 0- day being used to target security researchers in the past several weeks. DPRK threat actors used social media sites like X (formerly Twitter) to build rapport with their targets. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package. Upon successful exploitation, the shellcode conducts a series of anti-virtual machine checks and then sends the collected information, along with a screenshot, back to an attacker-controlled command and control domain. The shellcode used in this exploit is constructed in a similar manner to shellcode observed in previous North Korean exploits.

### 2023-09-18: Scarcruft exploits WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831) targeting the cryptocurrency industry
- https://paper.seebug.org/3033/
- This recent wave of attacks is noteworthy for revealing that, apart from the Lazarus Group, there are other North Korean-affiliated entities engaging in targeted operations against the cryptocurrency industry, which is relatively uncommon in the security community.
- The targets of this Konni group's recent attacks are notably different from their previous activities. Judging by the lure name, the attacks are directed towards the cryptocurrency industry. It is speculated that Konni may be exploring new attack vectors. The captured sample named "wallet_Screenshot_2023_09_06_Qbao_Network.zip", and it references Qbao Network, which is described as follows:

### 2023-10-30: FastViewer Variant Merged with FastSpy and disguised as a Legitimate Mobile Application
- Kimsuky has created a FastViewer variant that induces a victim to install the app onto their mobile device by disguising the malware as a legitimate Android application (APK file), such as Google Authenticator, an anti-virus program, or a payment service application. The FastViewer malware receives commands directly from the server without downloading additional malware, and the main purpose of this FastViewer variant is to steal information from infected devices. It appears that Kimsuky has developed this malware since at least July 2023 to target Republic of Korea victims. The report further notes that the disguised applications are expected to be distributed via spearphishing emails or smishing to trick targets into running them

- https://microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/22/diamond-sleet-supply-chain-compromise-distributes-a-modified-cyberlink-installer/)
- Microsoft has observed suspicious activity associated with the modified CyberLink installer file as early as October 20, 2023. The malicious file has been seen on over 100 devices in multiple countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Canada, and the United States. While Microsoft has not yet identified hands-on-keyboard activity carried out after compromise via this malware, the group has historically:
- If these criteria are not met, the executable continues running the CyberLink software and abandons further execution of malicious code. Otherwise, the software attempts to contact one of three URLs to download the second-stage payload embedded inside a file masquerading as a PNG file using the static User-Agent ‘Microsoft Internet Explorer’
- When invoked, the in-memory executable attempts to contact the following callbacks for further instruction. Both domains are legitimate but have been compromised by Diamond Sleet.

### 2024-06-12: UNC4899 - Insights on Cyber Threats Targeting Users and Enterprises in Brazil
- https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/cyber-threats-targeting-brazil
- North Korean Government-Backed Groups Targeting Brazil
- Since 2020, North Korean cyber actors have accounted for approximately a third of government-backed phishing activity targeting Brazil. North Korean government-backed actors have targeted the Brazilian government and Brazil’s aerospace, technology, and financial services sectors. Similar to their targeting interests in other regions, cryptocurrency and financial technology firms have been a particular focus, and at least three North Korean groups have targeted Brazilian cryptocurrency and fintech companies.
- In early 2024, PUKCHONG (UNC4899) targeted cryptocurrency professionals in multiple regions, including Brazil, using a Python app that was trojanized with malware. To deliver the malicious app, PUKCHONG reached out to targets via social media and sent a benign PDF containing a job description for an alleged job opportunity at a well known cryptocurrency firm. If the target replied with interest, PUKCHONG sent a second benign PDF with a skills questionnaire and instructions for completing a coding test. The instructions directed users to download and run a project hosted on GitHub. The project was a trojanized Python app for retrieving cryptocurrency prices that was modified to reach out to an attacker-controlled domain to retrieve a second stage payload if specific conditions were met.
- North Korean government-backed groups have also in the past targeted Brazil’s aerospace and defense industry. In one example, PAEKTUSAN created an account impersonating an HR director at a Brazilian aerospace firm and used it to send phishing emails to employees at a second Brazilian aerospace firm. In a separate campaign, PAEKTUSAN masqueraded as a recruiter at a major US aerospace company and reached out to professionals in Brazil and other regions via email and social media about prospective job opportunities. Google blocked the emails, which contained malicious links to a DOCX file containing a job posting lure that dropped AGAMEMNON, a downloader written in C++. The attacker also likely attempted to deliver the malware via messages on social media and chat applications like WhatsApp. The campaigns were consistent with [Operation Dream Job](https://clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dream-Job-Campaign.pdf) and activity previously [described by Google](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/).  In both campaigns, we also sent users [government-backed attacker alerts](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9007870?hl=en) notifying them of the activity and sharing information about how to keep their accounts safe.  
- One North Korean group, PRONTO, concentrates on targeting diplomats globally, and their targets in Brazil follow this pattern. In one case, Google blocked a campaign that used a denuclearization-themed phishing lure and the group’s typical phishing kit - a fake PDF viewer that presents the users with a login prompt to enter their credentials in order to view the lure document. In another case, PRONTO used North Korea news-themed lures to direct diplomatic targets to credential harvesting pages.
- One of the emerging trends we are witnessing globally from North Korean threat activity today is the insider threat posed by North Korean nationals [gaining employment surreptitiously](https://ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231018) at corporations to conduct work in various IT roles. Though we have not yet observed direct connections between any of these North Korean IT workers and Brazilian enterprises, we note the potential for it to present a future risk given the growing startup ecosystem in Brazil, historical activity by North Korean threat actors in Brazil, and expansiveness of this problem.

However, many of these threat actors can be classified into different groups under the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) of the Korean People's Army.
- Over the years, the RGB has revealed at least six threat groups
